Most compounds point to Gene Regulation (and expression) in the Nucleus
	Cell Proliferation - growing in size
	Cell Apoptosis - Programmed cell death (why we dont have webbed fingers!)

## Overview
Cell Communication is important in unicellular organisms
### Bacteria and Archaea
Quorum Sensing -
- mechanism for cells to monitor local cell density
	- biofilm formation
- Exchange of genetic material
![[Pasted image 20241028090922.png]]

### Yeast (single-cell eukaryote)
- mating type - sexual reproduction
![[Pasted image 20241028091013.png]]

Communication between cells requires: #MEMORIZE
- Ligand - signaling molecule
- Receptor protein - molecule to which the receptor binds
- *Signal transduction* - process that converts the information in the signal into a cellular response
![[Pasted image 20241028091235.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241028091524.png]]
receptors dont HAVE to be on the membrane
	lets steroid hormones work even though they're hydrophobic lol

All of your cells have effectively identical DNA, how do they perform different tasks??
- they communicate!!

# types of cell signaling
#MEMORIZE 
1. Direct Contact
2. Paracrine Signaling
3. Endocrine Signaling
4. Synaptic Signaline
Some cells send signals to themselves (autocrine signaling)
![[Pasted image 20241028091733.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241028091745.png]]
## Direct Contact
- molecules on the surface of one cell are recognized by receptors on the adjacent cell
![[Pasted image 20241028091854.png]]
- important in early development, immune response
- gap junctions and plasmodesmata allow signals to pass between adjacent cells
![[Pasted image 20241028091906.png]]

## Paracrine Signaling
- signal released from a cell has an effect on neighboring cells
- important in early development
- coordinates clusters of neighboring cells
- growth factors
![[Pasted image 20241028091948.png]]

## Synaptic Signaling
- Occurs in animals
- Nerve cells release the signal (neurotransmitter) which binds to receptors on nearby target cells (such as a muscle or another nerve cell)
- Association of neuron and target cell is a chemical synapse
![[Pasted image 20241028092047.png]]

## Endocrine (Hormonal) Signaling
- Hormones released from an endocrine system to affect other cells throughout the body
- Both animals and plants use this mechanism extensively
![[Pasted image 20241028092132.png]]

# Signal Transduction
- When a ligand binds to a receptor protein, the cell has a response
- Different cell types can have similar response to the same signal
	- Glucagon
- Different cell types can respond differently to the same signal
	- Epinephrine

# Role of Phosphorylation
- A cell's response to a signal often involves activating or inactivating proteins
- Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate group and is a common way to change the activity of a protein
- *Protein kinase* - an enzyme that *adds* a phosphate to a protein #MEMORIZE
- *Phosphatase* - an enzyme that *removes* a phosphate from a protein #MEMORIZE 
![[Pasted image 20241028092423.png]]

# Protein Phosphorylation
- Note: Phosphorylation can ACTIVATE or INACTIVATE a protein by changing its conformation
![[Pasted image 20241028092550.png]]
note that the Phosphate group is really small by comparison, and is pushing away the OH groups in the protein, causing the shape of the protein to subtly change. This lets phosphates be used as ON/OFF switches sometimes, its all context-dependant
# Protein Kinases and Phosphatases

adding a phosphate group has 3 outcomes:
1. Activated
2. Deactivated
3. Signal

# Receptor Types
receptors can be defined by  their location:
1. Intracellular receptors - located within the cell
	- ligands are very small and/or hydorphobic and can easily cross the membrane
2. Cell Surface receptors (membrane receptors) - located on the plasma membrane to bind a ligand outside the cell
	- Transmembrane proteins in contact with both the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment
	- ligands are hydrophobic and cannot easily cross the membrane

# Intracellular Signaling
Steroid Hormones
- cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, tertosterone
- common nonpolar, lipid-soluble structure
- can cross the plasma membrane and bind to an intracellular steroid receptor
- binding of the hormone to the receptor causes the complex to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
- act as regulators of gene expression
- diverse and far-ranging effects, longer acting

***Gene Expression = Transcription + Translation***

![[Pasted image 20241028093524.png]]

# Steroid Hormone Receptors
a steroid receptor has 3 functional domains:
1. Hormone-binding domain
2. DNA-binding domain
3. Domain that interacts with coactivators to affect level of gene transcription

in its inactive state, the receptor typically cannot bind to DNA because an inhibitor protein occupies the DNA binding site

Binding of ligand changes conformation, releasing inhibitor, and allowing translocation into the nucleus

![[Pasted image 20241028093804.png]]
# Three Major Groups of Membrane Receptors
1. Chemically gated ion channels
	channel-linked receptors that open to let a specific ion pass in response to a ligand
2. Enzymatic Receptors
	receptor is an enzyme that is activated by the ligand
	- almost all are protein kinases
3.  G protein-coupled receptor
	a G-protein (bound to GTP) assists in transmitting the signal from receptor to enzyme (effector)
![[Pasted image 20241028093953.png]]

# Signal Transduction Through Receptor Kinases
Protein kinases phosphorylate proteins to alter protein function
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
- influence cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism, and cell proliferation
	- alteration to function can lead to cancer
- Membrane receptor
- Plants possess receptors with a similar overall structure and function but are serine/threonine kinases

# Receptor Kinases
RTKs have:
- a single transmembrane domain
	- anchors them in membrane
- extracellular ligand-binding domain
	- ligands include growth factors, cytokines, hormones
- intracellular kinase domain
	- catalytic site of receptor acts as protein kinase.

When a ligand binds, *dimerization* and *autophosphorylation* occur

Cellular response follows - depends on cellular response proteins

![[Pasted image 20241028094258.png]]

# Example: The Insulin Receptor
- activated receptor has phosphoryylated sites that allow docking
- insulin is a protein hormone that helps to maintain a constant blood glucose level
- insulin binds to an RTK; insulin response protein binds to the phosphorylated receptor and is itself phosphorylated; signal is transmitted downstream to lower blood sugar
![[Pasted image 20241028094437.png]]

# Kinase Cascade
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases
- important class of cytoplasmic kinases
- mitogens (growth factors) stimulate cell division
- series of protein kinases that phosphorylate each other in succession
- amplifies the signal because kinases at each step can affect multiple substrates
- final result is usually phosphorylation of transcription factors that activate gene expression

![[Pasted image 20241028094612.png]]

why would cells signal like this?
- this allows a single signal to spread (amplify) to various parts of the cell

# Turning off the signal
- signaling pathways should only be turned on transiently
- inactivation of signaling pathway is as important as turning it on
- RTKs can be inactivated by two mechanisms
	- internalization of the receptor by endocytosis, followed by degradation/recycling
	- dephosphorylation by phosphastases
