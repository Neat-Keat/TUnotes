end of cell division today
exam next Wednesday

quiz this weekend!
	on Ch9 AND ch10
test covers ch7,8,9,10!

-----------

# Important terms to remember
- Chromosome
- Homologue
- Sister Chromatid
- Centromere
- Kinetochore
- Cohesin
- Condensin

Recall that bacteria do not do the cell cycle, they do binary fission!!
# Replication of Chromosomes
- before replication: chromosome = single DNA molecule
- After replication: chromosome = 2 identical DNA molecules
	- held together by *cohesin* proteins
- Visible as 2 strands held together at centromere as chromosome becomes more condensed

![[Pasted image 20241101090808.png]]
each copy is EXACT, the sister chromatids are held together by *cohesin*
	sister chromatids are IDENTICAL
	homologous chromosomes are similar
		#MEMORIZE homologues are NOT identical (they came from different parents!)

![[Pasted image 20241101090822.png]]

*Kinetochore* attaches to microtubules
	microtubles attach to chromatids and pull them apart

# Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
![[Pasted image 20241101090547.png]]
Interphase consists of:
- G1 (gap phase 1) - primary growth phase, longest phase
- S (synthesis) - replication of DNA
- G2 (gap phase 2) - organelles replicate, microtubules organize
M phase consists of:
- M (mitosis) - subdivided into 5 phases
	- Prophase
	- Prometaphase
	- Metaphase
	- Anaphase
	- Telophase
- C (cytokinesis) - separation of 2 new cells

G0 is just an idle period of lol
	they just metabolizing

# Duration
- time it takes to complete a cell cycle varies greatly between organisms and cell types
- fruit fly embryos = 8 minutes
- mature cells take longer to grow
	- typical mammalian cell takes 24 hours
	- liver cell takes more than a year
- Growth occurs during G1, G2, and S phases
	- M phase takes only an hour
- Most variation in length of G1
	- resting phase G0 - cells spend more or less time here

# Interphase
- G1, S, and G2 phases
	- G1 - cells undergo major portion of growth
	- S - replicate DNA
	- G2 - chromosomes coil more tightly using motot proteins; centrioles replicate; tubulin synthesis
	![[Pasted image 20241101091826.png]]
	#MEMORIZE have to know each of the phases and understand whats happening in each picture

# Overview of M phase
![[Pasted image 20241101091903.png]]
Mitosis is divided into 5 phases:
1. Prophase
2. Prometaphase
3. Metaphase
4. Anaphase
5. Telophase
#MEMORIZE the order!!!
prophase - start to see condensed chromosomes; nuclear envelope starts to disappear (into the ER)
# Prophase
- individual condensed chromosomes become visible with light microscope
	- condensation continues throughout prophase
- Spindle apparatus assembles
	- 2 centrioles move to opposite poles forming spindle apparatus (no centrioles in plants)
	- Asters - radial array of microtubules in animals (not plants)
![[Pasted image 20241101092219.png]]

# Prometaphase
- transition occurs after disassembly of nuclear envelope
- microtubule attachment
	- 2nd group grows from poles and attaches to kinetochores
	- each sister chromatid conencted to opposite poles
- Chromosomes begin to move to center of cell - congression
	- assembly and disassembly of microtubules
	- motor proteins at kinetochores
![[Pasted image 20241101092354.png]]

# Metaphase
- all chromosomes have achieved *bipolar attachment* to spindle #MEMORIZE
- very brief moment in time
- alignment of chromosomes along metaphase plate
	- not an actual structure
	- future axis of cell division
![[Pasted image 20241101092447.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241101092509.png]]

# Anaphase
- begins when centromes split
- key event is *removal of cohesin* proteins from all chromosomes
- sister chromatids pulled to opposite poles
- 2 forms of movements
	- Anaphase A - kinetochores pulled toward poles
	- Anaphase B - poles move apart
> Be able to parrot: "The sister chromatids are pulled apart"
![[Pasted image 20241101092652.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241101092658.png]]

# Telophase
- spindle apparatus disassembles
- nuclear envelope forms around each set of sister chromatids
	- now called chromosomes
- chromosomes begin to uncoil
- nucleolus reappears in each new nucleus
> opposite of prophase
![[Pasted image 20241101092817.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241101092824.png]]

# Cytokinesis
- cleavage of the cell into equal halves
> like pinching a drawstring bag closed
- animal cells - constriction of actin filaments produces a cleavage furrow
- plant cells - cell plate forms between the nuclei #MEMORIZE
- fungi and some protists - nuclear membrane does not dissolve; mitosis occurs within the nucleus; division of the nucleus occurs with cytokinesis
![[Pasted image 20241101093043.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241101093220.png]]
a. Actin ring!!

![[Pasted image 20241101093241.png]]
> be able to describe every stage in the cell cycle, and be able to draw this graph!! #MEMORIZE
# Important Points of Each Phase
- *Prophase*
	- chromosomes condense
	- mitotic spindle forms from a microtubule-organizing center
	- nuclear envelope breaks down
- *Prometaphase*
	- spindle fibers attach to sister chromatids
- *Metaphase*
	- metaphase plate
	- spindle fibers line up the chromosomes in the middle of the cell
- *Anaphase*
	- sister chromatids -> opposite poles of the cell
- *Telophase*
	- new nuclear envelopes form
	- mitotic spindle disintegrates
	- chromosomes decondense
	- **Cytokinesis happens here**

Aneuploidy = not true # of chromosomes
	this is super bad
	usually lethal
	the cell with too few just dies
	the cell with too many doesnt have too good of a shot

# How is the cell cycle controlled?
- What makes sure that the events happen at the right time and in the right order?

# Features of a cell-cycle control system
- mechanism for ensuring that events happen in the correct order
- ensure that events happen once and only once in a given cell cycle
- responsive to intracellular and extracellular signals
- robust - cell division can be completed successfully even if one part of system fails

# Control of the Cell Cycle
Current view integrates 2 concepts
1. Cell cycle has *2 irreversible points*
	1. replication of genetic material
	2. separation of the sister chromatids
2. Cell cycle can be put on hold at specific points called *checkpoints*
	1. process is checked for accuracy and can be halted if there are errors
	2. allows cell to respond to internal and external signals

# 3 checkpoints
1. G1/S checkpoint
	1. cell "decideds" to divide
	2. primary point for external signal influence
2. G2/M cheeckpoint
	1. cell makes a commitment to mitosis
	2. Assesses success of DNA replication
3. Late metaphase (spindle) checkpoint
	1. spindles know if they're being pulled on correctly/incorrectly
