ATPs energy comes from the breaking of the phosphate groups
	think of like a molecular coiled spring
	the negative charges repel each other
	bond between 3rd and 2nd as well as 2nd and 1st releases energy
		but NOT 1st and the ribose, because there's no charge!

# ATP cycle
- ATP hydrolysis drives *endergonic* reactions
	- unstable bonds have low activation energy and are easily broken
	- when broken, can transfer a considerable amount of energy
	- 7.3kcal/mol is released
	- coupled reaction results in net release of energy
		- ($\Delta$G = eexergonic and spontaneous)

- ATP not suitable for long-term energy storage
	- high energy bonds in ATP are unstable
	- Fats and carbohydrates better
	- Cells store only a few seconds worth of ATP; continually are making more ADP + P_i
- Estimated that even a sedentary individual turns over an amount of ATP in one day roughly equal to his or her body weight!

chemical work,
transport,
movement all require ATP

# Metabolism
- total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism
- *Anabolic* reactions/anabolism
	- expend energy to build up molecules
	- think of anabolic steroids to speed up muscle growth
- *Catabolic* reactions/catabolism
	- harvest energy by breaking down molecules

# Biochemical Pathways
- reactions occur in a sequence
- product of one reaction is the substrate for the next
- pathways are often compartmentalized inside organelles
