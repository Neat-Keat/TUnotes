The Molecules of Life
* all living things are made up of 4 classes of large biological molecules: #MEMORIZE 
	* *Nucleic Acids
	* *Proteins
	* *Carbohydrates*
	* *Lipids*

- Within cells, small organic molecules are joined together to form larger molecules (macromolecules)

| building blocks -> | Biologic macromolecules |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Sugars ->          | Carbohydrates           |
| Nucleotides ->     | Nucleic acids           |
| Amino acids ->     | Proteins                |
| Fatty Acids ->     | Lipids/membranes        |

Carbon
- many forms: from graphite to coal to diamonds
- affinity for bonding with other small atoms
- Capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds
	- HOW MANY? (4!)
- Known to form almost 10 million different compounds
	![[Pasted image 20240909091146.png]]
		# of protons? 6
		# of Neutrons? 6
		# of electrons? 6
		# of valence electrons? 4

Carbon: the "Backbone of Life"
- cells are 70-95% water, other 5-30% made up of many different carbon-based compounds
- framework of all biological molecules consists primarily of carbon bonded to
	- carbon
	- O,N,S,P, or H
- Carbon can form up to 4 covalent bonds
- Hydrocarbons - molecules consisting only of *carbon* and *hydrogen*
	- Nonpolar (why?)
		- *C and H have similar electronegativities* -> equal electron sharing
			- O & N -> very electronegative
		- hydrophobic
	- Functional groups add chemical properties
- *Organic chemistry*: study of compounds that contain carbon

nonpolar and hydrophobic go together
polar and hydrophilic go together

Property of Carbon: Versatility
- 4 valence electrons -> forms up to 4 covalent bonds
- straight chains, branches, rings, balls, tubes, coils
![[Pasted image 20240909091920.png]]

Functional groups
	Functional groups are specific molecular groups that bond to carbon-hydrogen cores
		- each group has unique chemical properties
		- properties of functional groups are retained wherever they attach and influence behavior of entire molecule in reactions
	![[Pasted image 20240909092103.png]]

Hydroxyl is polar
- means the H atom can participate in polar hydrogen bonding!
Carbonyl is polar
- oxygen will be partially positive
Carboxyl is polar
- H is partially positive
- both O's are partially negative
Amino is polar
	H+
	N-
Phosphate groups carry at least 1 full negative charge
	VERY polar
Methyl is NONPOLAR

Macromolecules
- carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are all *polymers*
- *Polymers* are long molecules built by linking together chemical subunits called *monomers*
- Long chains are built by *dehydration reactions*
- Broken down by *hydrolysis reactions*

Dehydration synthesis
	formation of larger molecules by the removal of water
	Monomers are joined to form polymers
	![[Pasted image 20240909092838.png]]

Hydrolysis
- breakdown of large molecules by the addition of water
- polymers are broken down to monomers
-![[Pasted image 20240909093048.png]]

where does the input of energy happen for these interactions to occur?
	Enzymes! (aka catalysts)

Macromolecules
* Polymer - built by linking monomers
* Monomer - small, similar chemical subunits

A few more chemistry terms: Isomers
* Molecules with the same molecular or empirical formula (ie same atomic composition), but a different arrangement of those atoms in space
	* *Structural isomers*: atoms are arranged in completely different order
	* EX: Butane and Isobutane
		![[Pasted image 20240909093609.png]]
	* *Stereoisomers* - atoms are arranged in the same order, but differ in how groups are attached to the carbon skeleton
		* Enantiomers - specialized type of stereoisomers
			* mirror image molecules
			* chiral
			* arises from asymmetry when carbon is attached to 4 different molecules
			* biologic examples: D-sugars and L-amino acids
		* Why does this matter?
			* Enzymes in biological systems generally recognize only a single, specific stereoisomer

Carbohydrates
* molecules with a 1:2:1 ratio of Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
* Empirical formula(CH2O)n
* C-H covalent bonds hold much energy
	* carbohydrates are good energy storage molecules
	* examples: sugars, starch, glucose
* Other roles:
	* structural (cellulose), cell identity

Monosaccharides
- simplest carbohydrate
- 6 carbon sugars play important roles
- Glucose C6H12O6
- Fructose is a structural isomer of glucose
- Galactose is a stereoisomer of glucose
- Enzymes that act on different sugars can distinguish structural and stereoisomers of this basic 6-carbon skeleton
	![[Pasted image 20240909094124.png]]
Glucose can convert back and forth between a linear and ring form in an aqueous environment
	![[Pasted image 20240909094218.png]]


$\alpha$ - glucose - the OH points down
$\beta$ -glucose - the OH points up

Glycosidic Linkage #MEMORIZE \
- Bond between 2 monosaccharides
- any 2 hydroxyl groups
- location and geometry of these bonds vary widely
- the monomers can be identical or different

Disaccharides
- 2 monosaccharides linked together by dehydration synthesis
- used for sugar transport or energy storage
- examples: sucrose, lactose, maltose
	- sucrose = glucose + fructose (table sugar)
	- lactose - glucose + galactose (mik sugar)
	- maltose = glucose + glucose (grains)
	![[Pasted image 20240909094651.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240909094713.png]]

Polysaccharides
- long chains of monosaccharides
	- linked through dehydration synthesis
- energy storage
	- plants use starch
	- animals use glycogen
- structural support
	- plants use cellulose
	- arthropods and fungi use chitin
