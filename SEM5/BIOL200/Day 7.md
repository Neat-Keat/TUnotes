Starches and Glycogen
	*Amylose* forms coils, is insoluble in water; unbalanced glucose chains
	*Amylopectin* branched amylose chains
	*Glycogen (animals)*: insoluble, branched amylose chains, but much longer chain length and more branches that plant starch

*glycosidic linkage* is the bond that forms between 2 sugars
these form through *dehydration synthesis*
by removing a molecule of *water*

C6H12O6+C6H12O6 = C12H22O11 + H2O (Sucrose + Water)

polysaccharides = long ass sugars

glucose 
alpha(1,4) linkage makes starch (amylose)
beta(1-4) linkage make cellulose (with flipping!)
	are straighter, and have ADDITIONAL bonds between them
		they are much stronger
	we eat it for digestive health, its indigestible (we can't break it down), but it keeps everything else moving along.

chains of beta glucose: one's pointed up, next is pointing down (flipped), alternating

Which of the following is the proper hierarchy starting with the simplest?
 A. *Proton < Carbon < Glucose < Cellulose*

Which of the following is the proper hierarchy starting with the simplest?
 A. Neutron < Oxygen < Glucose < Starch

(Sugars have a 1:2:1 ratio of Carbon:Hydrogen:Oxygen)

The chemical formula for both of the mono-saccharides glucose and fructose are C6H12O6. What is the chemical formula for the disaccharide sucrose?
 B. C12 H22O11 (- 1 water)

find chemical formula of a polysaccharide with 10 glucose subunits hooked together
(C6H12O6)10 - (H2O)9 =
C60H120O60 - H18O9 =
C60H102O51

Nucleic acids
------
- polymer = nucleic acids
- monomers = nucleotides
	- sugar + phospate + nitrogenous base
	- sugar is deoxyribose in RNA or ribose in RNA
	- Nitrogenouse bases include
		- purines: adenine and guanince
		- pyrimidines: thymine, cytosine, uracil
	- Nucleotides connected by phosphodiester bonds

- 5 Carbon Sugar
	- Ribose
		- RNA
	- Deoxyribose
		- DNA

we already numbered the ones in the ring, so the ones in the sugar are numbered with a prime (')

Phosphate groups are polar enough to have a net negative charge (-1, not just a partial charge)

nitrogen base is 1 ring or 2
	made of Carbon or Nitrogen (above, anywhere without an N is a C)

__3 Parts of a Nucleotide__ 
-nitrogenous base
-phosphate group
-sugar

Pyrimidines are the longer word, have the smaller rings
Purines are have 2 rings (*Pure* *A*s *G*old)

DNA => ACG T
RNA => ACG U

only difference between U and T is a methyl group (H3C)
![[Pasted image 20240911093400.png]]
how do we hook nucleotides together?
	Dehydration synthesis!
	3' Hydroxyl (OH) with the 5' Phosphate group of the next
		this is called a Phosphodiester linkage

![[Pasted image 20240911093537.png]]
this picture has 4 nucleotides hooked together
nucleotides are directional (their ends are different!)
	 DNA has a 5' end (it has a free 5' phosphate group at the end)
		 at the other end is a free 3' hydroxyl group

the 3' end is the ___ONLY___ place a new nucleotide can be ended
	NEVER EXTENDED AT 5' END


___DNA___
* encodes info for amino acid sequence of proteins
	* specified by sequence of bases
- double helix - 2 polynucleotide strands connected by *hydrogen Bonds*
	- base pairing rules
		- A with T (or U in RNA) (double hydrogen bond)
		- C with G (triple hydrogen bond)
	- DNA molecules are very stable
	- Strands are anti-parallel (they're parallel, but they point in opposite ends)
	- see below how 1 strand has a 5' end and the other has a 3' end
![[Pasted image 20240911094048.png]]

Sample DNA
-> 5' ATATCCCGGA 3'
-> 3' TATAGGGCCT 5'

DNA is SUPER stable bc of the amount of hydrogen bonds
	we need to boil the DNA (>95C, >200F) to separate them in science

Ribonucleic acid (RNA)
- RNA similar to DNA except
	- contains ribose instead of deoxyribose
	- containse uracil instead of thymine
- Single-stranded
- Many roles:
	- mRNA
		- \usues info in DNA to specify sequence of amino acids in proteins
	- rRNA
		- structural part of ribosome 
	- tRNA
		- transports amino acids to site of protein synthesis
	- Recently discovered roles in regulating gene expression  (miRNA, siRNA)
