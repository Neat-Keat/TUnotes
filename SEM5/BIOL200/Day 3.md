where we're headed
	CH1 content isnt super content dense
	understand the 7 traits of living things
		be able to list them out
	Ch2 is dense
		this stuff is *super* important, so pay attention

--------------
class tip of the day:
	always have paper and something to write with
	"dont need to verbatim type what i write down"
	handwriting is better than typing  *yawn* 

Emergent Properties Ex
	Na + Cl => NaCl
	(Sodium) + (chlorine gas) => table salt

	Human consciousness is a good example

	cities have emergent properties

Outline:
- Atoms/Periodic table
- Chemical bonds and electron sharing
- Wonders of Water
- pH (acids and bases)

Nature of Atoms
- Matter has mass and occupies space
- All matter is composed of atoms
- Atom = smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element

- Understanding the structure of atoms is critical to understanding the nature of biological molecules

Atoms are composed of:
	Protons
		+ charge
		in the nucleus
		mass = 1 Dalton or Atomic Mass Unit (AMU)
	Neutrons
		neutral charge
		in the nucleus
		mass = 1 Dalton
	Electrons
		- charge
		in orbitals surrounding the nucleus
		1/2000 Dalton (negligible)

* Electons are found in *shells* surrounding the nucleus
- number of protons = number of electrons
- most of an atom's volume is empty space

![[Pasted image 20240830091250.png]]

* *Atomic number* is unique for each element; equals # of protons
* *Atomic Mass = # protons + # neutrons*
* Charge is neutral if #protons = #electrons
* Electrons in the outermost shell determine chemical properties of each element

Mass or Weight?
- Mass = amount of substance
- Weight - refers to force gravity exerts on substance
Sum of protons

from left to right, Atomic number increases
Neutrons in a typical atom = atomic mass - protons

#EX A neutral atom has an atomic number of 15 and has 16 neutrons. What is the atom's atomic mass and how many electrons does it have?
	P: 15
	N: 16
	E:: 15
	AMass: 31

#EX A neutral atom has an atomic mass of 12 and 6 neutrons. WHat is the atomic number and how many electrons does it have?
	P: 6
	N: 6
	E: 6
	AMass: 12

Isotopes
- Atoms of a single element (e.g. carbon) that possesses different numbers of *neutrons*
- Radioactive isotopes are unstable and emit radiation as the nucleus breaks up
	- Half-life - time it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay
- same # of protons, different # of neutrons

Energy Levels:
- electrons have potential energy related to their position
	- Electrons farther from nucleus have more energy
- Be careful not to confuse *energy levels*, which are drawn as rings to indicate an electron’s energy, with orbitals, which have a variety of three-dimensional shapes and indicate an electron’s most likely location.

*Octet Rule* 
2 -8 -8 -> # of protons in each electron orbital level
layer 1 can have 1 or 2
in 4 orbital layers, fill them up with 1 by 1 clockwise (see Li -> Ne, 2 pics up)
	we need to know how many unpaired electrons any atom has

The atomic # of nitrogen is 7. What is the electron configuration?
![[Pasted image 20240830093931.png]]

Atoms tend to interact in ways that satisfy the octet rule

Silicon is # 14, whats the electron config?

Periodic table displays elements according  
to valence electrons  
• *Valence electrons* – number of electrons in  
outermost energy level  
• Inert (nonreactive) elements have all eight  
electrons in the outermost level  
• *Octet rule* – atoms tend to establish  
completely full outer energy levels

Chemical bonds
	Molecules are groups of atoms held together in a stable association
	Compounds are molecules containing more than one type of element
	Atoms are held together in molecules or compounds by chemical bonds

Covalent Bonds
	Form when 1 or more pairs of valence electrons are shared by 2 atoms
	Strong Bond
	![[Pasted image 20240830094503.png]]
	- Form when atoms share 2 or more valence electrons  
	• Results in no net charge, satisfies octet rule, no unpaired electrons  
	• Strength of covalent bond depends on the number of shared electrons  
	• Many biological compounds are composed of more than 2 atoms – an atom may share electrons with 2 or more atoms

![[Pasted image 20240830094602.png]]
Covalent bonds are very difficult to break


*Ions* are charged atoms

*Ionic Bonds*
	- Formed by the attraction of oppositely charged *ions*
	![[Pasted image 20240830094834.png]]
	loss of electron -> *cation* (positive charge)
	gain of electron -> *anion* (negative charge)
	Cations+ and anions- are attracted = Ionic Bond
