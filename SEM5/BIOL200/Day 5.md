where we are:
- lots of content to cover
- stuff on BB is rearranged
	- everything related to lecture is under course content
		- including quizzes under the weekly quizzes folder
			- do them in one sitting
			- use them to study after they close
	- all class work will be opened this weekend if you want to redo it through sunday night
		- redo the quiz??
	- Unit 1 folder has all the content on the first exam

Characteristics of water
- water contains polar covalent bonds
- Oxygen has a partial negative charge ($\delta -$)
- Hydrogen has a partial positive charge ($\delta +$)
- Opposite ends have opposite charges
Water can form *hydrogen bonds*
- weak electrical attractions between water molecules
- can also form between water and other polar molecule

O and N are very electronegative
C and H are not

water is polar -> unequal sharing of electrons
CH4 is nonpolar -> equal sharing of electrons (C and H have very similar electronegativities)

Properties of water
1. Water has a high specific heat
	- a large amount of energy is required to change the temperature of water
	- amount of energy required to change 1g of a material by 1$\degree$ C
	- water resists temperature changes as a result
		- helps mitigate dramatic temperature changes globally and in organisms
2. Water has a high heat of vaporization
	- The evaporation of water from a surface causes cooling of that surface
	- energy to transform liquid water at 100C to steam at
	- sweating cools us down because to evaporate sweat your thermal energy breaks the hydrogen bonds in the sweat.
3. Solid water is less dense than liquid water
	- bodies of water freeze from the top down, not bottom up
		- lets fish live! :D
4. Water is a good solvent
	- water dissolves polar molecules and ions
5. water organizes nonpolar molecules
	* Hydrophilic "water-loving"
	* hydrophobic "water-fearing"
	* water causes hydrophobic molecules to aggregate or assume specific shapes
6. Water can form ions

Magic properties of water: cohesion and adhesion
	Cohesion
		- Binding between like molecules
		- Water molecules bind to each other
		- Results in high surface tension
	Adhesion
		- binding between unlike molecules
		- Clinging of water to surfaces
		- Meniscus in graduated cylinders

	really tall trees use cohesion and adhesion forces to get water from the root to the leaves

The universal solvent
	*water dissolves ionic & polar covalent bonds*
	- Hydrophilic compounds: ions & polar molecules that stay in solution
	- H-bonding allows almost any charged or polar molecule to dissolve in water

	- Hydrophobic molecules (uncharged and nonpolar) do not dissolve in water

mixing olive oil and vinegar, they separate!
	the aqueous layer is polar
	the olive oil is non-polar

Magic properties of Water: the pH Scale and Buffers
- Pure water - molecules can form H+ and OH- ions
	- [H+] (hydrogen ion concentration of 10^-7 mol/L) 
	- considered to be neutral
	- Neither acidic nor basic
- The pH scale is logarithmic
	- pH = -log[H+]
	- Greater H+ concentration = *lower pH* = more acidic
	- Lower H+ concentration = *higher pH* = more basic/alkaline
- *Buffers* are compounds that minimize changes in pH
- mol/L = M

Acids and Bases - pH
- Acid
	- Any substance that dissociates in water to increase the [H+] (and lower the pH)
	- The stronger an  acid is, the more hydrogen ions it produces and the lower its pH
- Base
	- Substance that combines with H+ dissolved in water, and thus lowers the [H+]

![[Pasted image 20240906094504.png]]

Buffers
- substance that resists changes in pH
- Act by
	- releasing hydrogen ions when a base is added
	- absorbing hydrogen ions when acid is added
- Overall effect of keeping [H+] relatively constant
