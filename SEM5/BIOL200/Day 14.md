4 structures found in all cells:
1. ribosomes
	1. protein synthesis
	2. made of protein + RNA
2. Cytoplasm
	1. jelly-like substance with everything in it
3. nucleus/nucleoid region
	1. stores genetic information
4. plasma membrane
	1. phospholipid bilayer
		1. selectively permeable, keeps some things in and some things out
		2. embedded proteins allow it to transport materials either along or against their []s (NA+/K+ pump)
		3. communicate with other cells
		4. cell-cell connection
		5. ...

# Cell classification
Prokaryotes
	- unicellular
		- Archaea
		- Bacteria
	- cell walls - peptidoglycan
		- "like a 1 room schoolhouse"
	- single circular chromosome
Eukaryotes
	- multiple linear chromosomes


Prokaryotic Cells
- simplest organisms
- lack a membrane-bound nucleus
	- DNA is present in the nucleoid region
	- typically have a single circular chromosome
- Cell wall outside of plasma membrane
	- strength and shape of cell determined by cell wall
- Do contain ribosomes (but not membrane-bound organelles)

E. Coli - 4.4 Mega Bases (4.4 million nucleotides long)
our chromosomes are 4 billion long

prokaryotic cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (a polysaccharide cross linked with peptides)

pilli lets bacteria stick to stuff (like plaque to your teeth!)

the flagellum spins really fast and lets the cell move

archaea and bacteria are both unicellular, but thats about it

archaea are extremophiles, they live in the yellowstone geysers (80 C), etc

# Bacterial cell walls
- most bacterial cells are encased by strong cell wall
	- composed of *peptidoglycan*
	- cell walls of plants, fungi, and most protists different
- protect the cell, maintain its shape, and prevent excessive uptake or loss of water
- susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics often depends on the structure of their cell walls
- archaea lack peptidoglycan

we dont have cell walls?
	our medicine targets the cell walls of bacteria, weakens it, and then the bacteria burst

# Archaea vs Bacteria
- archaea cell walls lack peptidoglycan, but are made up of various chemical compouns including polysaccharides and proteins
- Archaeal membranes contain different types of lipids
- Archaea DNA replication and protein synthesis more closely related to eukaryotes at molecular level 

# Flagella
- Present in some prokaryotic cells
	- May be one or more or none
	- Made up of protein fibers
- Used for locomotion
- Rotary motion propels the cell – powered by proton gradient
- Can turn at 200-1000 rpm; some bacteria can travel up to 60 cell lenths/sec
	- thats like you travelling at 360 ft/s by gyrating

dont need to memorize structure, but know what flagella are and what they do (spin to move)

# Eukaryotic Cells
- Possess a membrane-bound nucleus
- more complex than prokaryotic cells
- compartmentalization!
	- achieved through use of membrane-bound organelles and endomembrane system
- Possess a cytoskeleton for support and to maintain cellular structure
	- not ALL have a cell wall (plant cell vs animal cell)
- all multi-cellular organisms are eukaryotes, and some unicellular organisms are eukaryotes -> there ARE single celled eukaryotes

Eu = "True"
Kary"kernel"
	means they have a nucleus!!

compare and contrast Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes #MEMORIZE
	Eukaryotes are:
		10x bigger
		more complex
		compartmentalization

^^animal cell from textbook
	no cell wall
	no chloroplast

![[Pasted image 20240930093204.png]]
^^ plant cell from textbook
	cell wall
	central vacuole
	chloroplast
	mitochondrion?
		all eukaryotes do!

be able to identify the name & function of all parts just from the images

# Nucleus
- repository of the genetic information
- most eukaryotic cells possess a single nucleus
- nucleolus - region where ribosomal RNA synthesis takes place
- Nuclear envelope
	- 2 phospholipid bilayers
	- nucluear pores - control passage in and out
	- nuclear lamina - network of fibers on inner surface; made of nuclear lamins; give nucleus shape (looks like a mesh)
- In eukaryotes, the DNA is divided into multiple linear chromosomes and organized into chromatin
	- chromatin = chromosomes + protein

![[Pasted image 20240930093820.png]]

be able to identify:
	membrane, pores, lamina, nucleolus

# Ribosomes

Recall Central Dogma
	DNA ---(transcribed to)---> RNA ---(translated to)---> Protein

ribosomes found on the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
	found BOTH on Rough ER AND in the cytoplasm

made of Protein & RNA, comprised of 2 subunits
	large subunit
	small subunit

Ribosomes:
- Cell's protein synthesis machinery
- found in all cell types in all 3 domains
- composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-protein complex
- 1 large + 1 small subunit
- protein synthesis also require messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA)
- Ribosomes may be free in cytoplasm or associated with internal membranes
	- free ribosomes synthesize proteins found in cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, other organelles
	- membrane-assoc. ribosomes synthesize membrane proteins, proteins to be exported, and proteins found in endomembrane system

# Endomembrane System
* Series of membranes throughout the cytoplasm
- Divides cell into compartments where different cellular functions occur
- One of the fundamental distinctions between eukaryotes and prokaryotes

# Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
	- Attachment of ribosomes to the membrane gives a rough appearance
	- Synthesis of proteins to be secreted, sent to lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membrane
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)
	- Relatively few bound ribosomes
	- Many enzymes embedded in membranes
	- Variety of functions – carb and lipid synthesis, store  intracellular Ca2+, detoxification of foreign substances

- ratio of RER to SER depends on cell's function
	- Cells that carry out extensive lipid synthesis (brain, testes, intestine) have more SER
	- cells that synthesize proteins that are secreted (like anti-bodies) have more RER
