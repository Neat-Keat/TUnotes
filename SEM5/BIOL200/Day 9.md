whats going on this week?
	test friday
	SI sessions sent out in an email
	quiz due lmfao
	finishing protein structures today


-----------------

building blocks of proteins and the levels of organization

carbs, proteins, and nucleotides are all polar
	lipids are not

need to know the function of the molecules in each of the 4 groups


The monomer for proteins is
the polymer for proteins is 

be able to list the biologic macromolecules, filling out the table

| biologic macromolecule | polymer | Bond | Examples/functions |
carbs
nucleic acids
proteins
lipids

every amino acid has:
- Central carbon
- amino group
- carboxyl group
- single H
- "R" group

remember that COOH is both charged AND polar

in proteins, shape determines function
	as a result, we now consider how their component parts fold

Note the repeating NCC group
	and the double bonded O's
	all the H's and O's in the "backbone" can hydrogen bond

5' ends with a phosphate group
3' ends with a hydroxyl(?) group
	similarly
N-terminus ends with Amino group (Nitrogen)
C-termiuns ends with Carboxyl group (Carbon)

The sequence of a protein determines its structure
Primary 1^0
- Amino acid sequence -> polypeptide chain
- enormous potential for diversity
	- how many different 100 a.a. polypeptides are possible?
	- 20^100 = 1.26 * 10^130
- Held together by peptide bonds

Secondary 2^0
- bending results from H-bonds within AMINO and CARBOXYL groups in peptide backbone
	-  $\alpha$ helix
	- $\beta$ sheet
![[Pasted image 20240916092709.png]]
- has nothing to do with R groups

Tertiary 3^0
- final folded shape of a globular protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain
- further bending from interactions between R groups on the chain
- they fold in water! non-polar R groups get clustered in the center by hydrophobic exclusion #MEMORIZE

Quaternary 4^0
- interaction and arrangement of individual chains (subunits) in a protein with 2 or more polypeptide chains
- ex: hemoglobin
- held together by the same list of forces for tertiary organization
- NOT ALL proteins have 4^0 structure

skipping a few topics, on to
Denaturation
- protein loses structure and function and even unfolds completely
- Due to change in environmental conditions
	- pH
	- Temperature
		- breaks hydrogen bonds by definition of temperature
		- thats why high fevers are so bad
		- egg cooking example
			- the coagulation step is irreversible
	- Ionic concentration of solution
	![[Pasted image 20240916093647.png]]
	Denaturation /= Hydrolysis
	* denaturation is the unfolding of the structure
	* hydrolysis is the cleaving of the structure


Example questions!
1. Carbon is important for biology because:
	1. of the variety of carbon skeletons and functional groups that can be built on them
2. pH of 7.5 to pH of 5.5; difference is:
	1. Increases by 100 fold
3. amino end and carboxyl end refers to
	1. Proteins
4. Dehydration synthesis
	1. links monomers
	2. removes water to form bonds
	3. is involved in protein synthesis
5. during denaturation, whats NOT disturbed?
	1. covalent bonds
