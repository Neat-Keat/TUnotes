# Glycolysis
- converts 1 glucose (6 carbons) to 2 pyruvate (3 carbons)
- 10-step biochemical pathway
- occurs in the cytoplasm
- *Net* production of 2 ATP molecules by substrate-level phosphorylation
- 2 NADH produced by the reduction of NAD+

# NADH must be recycled
for glycolysis to continue, NADH must be recycled to NAD+ by either:
1. Aerobic respiration
	1. Oxygen is available as the final electron acceptor.
	2. produces significant amount of ATP
2. Fermentation
	1. Occurs when oxygen is not available
	2. organic molecule is the final electron acceptor.

# Fate of Pyruvate
- depends on oxygen avalibility
	- when oxygen is present, pyrivate is oxidized to acetyl coenzyme ! (acetyl-CoA) which enters the citric acid cycle
		- aerobic respiration
	- Without oxygen, pyruvate is reduced in order to oxidize NADH back to NAD+
		- Fermentation.

# Pyruvate Oxidation
- in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is oxidized
	- occurs in mitochondria in eukaryotes
		- multienzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reaction
	- Occurs at the plasma membrane in prokaryotes

# Products of pyruvate oxidation
- From each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule:
	- 1 CO2
		- Decarboxylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase
	- 1 NADH
	- 1 acetyl-CoA which consists of 2 carbons from pyruvate attached to coenzyme A
		- Acetyl-CoA proceeds to the citric acid cycle

# Citric Acid Cycle
- Oxidizes the acetyl group from pyruvate
- Occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria
- Biochemical pathway of nine steps in three segments
	1.  Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate -> citrate
	2. Citrate rearrangement and decarboxylation
	3. Regeneration of oxaloacetate

# Citric Acid Cycle Yield
- each Acetyl-CoA entering the citric acid cycle:
	- Releases 2 molecules of CO2
	- Reduces 3 NAD+ to 3 NADH
	- Reduces 1 FAD (electron carrier) to FADH2
	- Produces 1 ATP
	- Regenerates oxaloacetate

# Glucose yield after citric acid cycle
Glucose has been oxidized to:
- 6 CO2
- 4 ATP
- -10 NADH
- -2 FADH2
note NADH and FADH2 proceed to the electron transport chain

Electron transfer has released 53kcal/mol of energy by gradual energy extraction
Energy will be put to use to manufacture ATP

# Electron Transport Chain
- ETC is a series of membrane-bound electron carriers
- embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane
- Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred to complexes of the ETC
- Each complex in the chain operates as a *proton pump*, driving protons to the intermembrane space
- electrons move from protein complex to protein complex

# Key Aspects of Electron Transport
- free energy DROPS
- where does it end? has to be a final electron acceptor:
	- ***Oxygen***
- for every 2 e- carriers (4 electrons), one 02 is reduced to 2H2O
- where does the lost free energy go? (not just heat!)
