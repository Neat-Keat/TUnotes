Aerobic respiration has 4 steps:
1. Glycolysis
2. Pyruvate Oxidation
3. Citric Acid Cycle
4. Electron Transport Chain
	1. protons are charged, cant pass the phospholipid membrane
		1. can only pass back thru with the ATP Synthase Enzyme

in the matrix of the mitochondria:
	the end of the ETD: electrons that have lost their energy HAVE to go to a final electron acceptor (ie Oxygen in Aerobic respiration)

# Energy yield of respiration
Theoretical energy yield
	32 ATP per glucose in bacteria #MEMORIZE 
	30 in Eukaryotes #MEMORIZE
P/O ratio (phosphate-to-oxygen ratio) is the amount of ATP synthesized per 02 molecule
Theoretical and direct calculation of P/O has been contentious and has changed over time

# regulation of respiration
Example of feedback inhibition
2 key control points:
1. In glycolysis
	1. phosphofructokinase is allosterically inhibited by ATP and/or citrate
2. In pyruvate oxidation/citric acid cycle
	1. Pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibited by high levels of NADH
	2. Citrate synthetase inhibited by high levels of ATP

# Oxidation without O2
1. Anaerobic respiration
	1. use of *inorganic* molecules (other than O2) as final electron acceptor at end of ETC
	2. Many prokaryotes use sulfur, nitrate, carbon dioxide or even inorganic metals
2. Fermentation
	1. use of *organic* molecules as final electron acceptor
	2. ATP generation from glycolysis only

# Anaerobic respiration
Dont need to memorize just know it mostly happens in prokaryotes

Methanogens
- CO2 is reduced to CH4 (methane)
- found in diverse organisms including cows
Sulfur prokaryotes
- inorganic sulfate (SO4) is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
- Early sulfate reducers set the stage for evolution of photosynthesis

# 2 types of fermentation
Based on NADH e- acceptor: pyruvate or acetaldehyde 
![[Pasted image 20241022224315.png]]
^^^ this is what happens when you work out and your muscles run out of O2
OR:
![[Pasted image 20241022224454.png]]
^^^like yeast!
# Fermentation
Reduces organic molecules in order to regenerate NAD+
1. Ethanol fermentation occurs in yeast
	1. CO2, ethanol, and NAD+ are produced
2. Lactic acid fermentation
	1. occurs in animal cells (especially muscles)
	2. electrons are transferred from NADH to pyruvate to produce lactic acid
![[Pasted image 20241022224709.png]]

# Why ferment when you could respire?
- ATP yields:
	- respiration: 30 ATP/1 glucose
	- fermentation: 2 ATP/1 glucose
- Where do most ATP come from?
- what is required?

-> you ***DONT*** ferment if you can respire

# Catabolism of protein
dont need to remember, but heres a quick recap:

amino acids undergo deamination to remove the amino group
remainder of the amino acid is converted to a molecule that enters glycolysis or the citric acid cycle
- Alanine is converted to pyruvate
- aspartate is converted to oxaloacetate

deamination:
![[Pasted image 20241022225007.png]]

# Catabolism of fat
fats are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol
- fatty acids are converted to acetyl groups by $\beta$-oxidation
- oxygen-dependent process
the respiration of a 6-carbon fatty acid yields 20% more energy than a 6-carbon glucose
![[Pasted image 20241022225223.png]]
just need to know that fatty acids get broken down 2 carbons at a time to make Acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle

![[Pasted image 20241022225317.png]]

# Evolution of metabolism
Hypothetical timeline:
1. Ability to store chemical energy in ATP
2. Evolution of glycolysis
	1. pathway found in all living organisms
3. Anoxygenic photosynthesis (using H2S)
4. Use of H2O in photosynthesis (not H2S)
	1. begins permanent change in Earth's atmosphere
5. Evolution of nitrogen fixation
6. Aerobic respiration evolved most recently

just know that glycolysis is ancient, in all organisms, and occurs in the cytoplasm

# Outline
- photosynthesis defined
- electron excitation and energy
- CO2 and the Calvin cycle

# Animation Overview

- This is a very helpful 3D animation of the entire process of photosynthesis!

# Photosynthesis Overview
- energy for *all* life on earth ultimately comes from photosynthesis
	6CO2 + 12 H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2
- what goes in:
	- CO2, H2O, light (photons)
- what comes out:
	- ATP, Oxygen, sugar (*usually* glucose)
- *Oxygenic photosynthesis is carried out by*
	- cyanobacteria
	- 7 groups of algae
	- all land plants - chloroplasts

![[Pasted image 20241022233816.png]]
# The structure of the Chloroplast
- photosynthesis occurs in the *chloroplast*
- Thylakoids
	- flattened internal membranes of chloroplasts
- Grana
	- stacks of thylakoids
- Stroma
	- space between the thylakoids and the inner membrane
![[Pasted image 20241022233935.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241022234048.png]]
#MEMORIZE the different parts of the chloroplast

# Photosynthesis: 2 reactions
- the *photo* portion (light dependent reactions)
	- light energy converted to chemical energy
	- H2O -> O2
![[Pasted image 20241022234137.png]]
- the *synthesis* portion (light independent)
	- the Calvin cycle
	- CO2 -> carbohydrates

![[Pasted image 20241022234358.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20241022234541.png]]
# The electromagnetic spectrum
- light = electromagnetic radiation
	- particle = photons
	- wave = wavelength

- each photon or wavelength has a specific amount of energy
	- shorter wavelengths = more energy (blue, UV)
	- longer wavelengths = less energy (red, infrared)

- photoelectric effect = removal of an electron from a molecule by light

![[Pasted image 20241022234730.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241022234741.png]]
# absorption spectrum
when a photon strikes a molecule, its energy is either:
- lost as heat
- absorbed by the electrons of the molecule
	- boosts electrons into higher energy level
- absorption spectrum - range and efficiency of photons a molecule is capable of absorbing

![[Pasted image 20241022234848.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241022234942.png]]

# Chlorophyll
- two kinds
- chlorophyll a
	- main photosynthetic pigment
- chlorophyll b
	- broadens the light spectrum used

![[Pasted image 20241022235029.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241022235150.png]]


# Light excites electrons in pigments
- absorbed light excites electrons
- fates for excited electrons:
	- drop back down to a lower energy -> fluorescence
	- drop back down to a lower energy -> heat
	- excite an electron in a nearby pigment and induce resonance
	*- transferred to an electron acceptor in a redox reaction*
here we study the last one 

# Photosystem Organization
- antenna complex
	- hundreds of accessory pigment molecules
	- gather photons and feed the captured light energy to the reaction center
- reaction center
	- 1 ore more chlorophyll a molecules
	- passes excited electrons out of the photosystem to electron acceptor
