Sunlight --(captured and converted into)--> ATP and NADPH
	NADPH is not a type! its a high energy electron carrier!

this chemical energy  is used to drive the Calvin Cycle (endergonic!)
	it does a process called Carbon Fixation
		takes low energy carbon and hooks them together
these processes occur:
	photo part in the thylakoid membrane
	synthesis part in the stroma (the matrix of the mitochondria)

sunlight hits the chloroplasts ( a pigment embedded in the membrane)
	light reactions happen, ATP is created, and NADPH is reduced
	this ALSO releases O2 as a byproduct
then, in the stroma, CO2 diffuses into the plant leaves, and the calvin cycle hooks the carbons into larger molecules
	releases CH2O (sugar)
	feeds NADP+ and ADP + Pi back into the thylakoid

O2 is the final electron acceptor at the end of the ETC #MEMORIZE


plants look green because they absorb purple and red
	ie they reflect "green" back to us

the red and purple wavelengths of light excite the electrons in azocaseine

fluorescence -> releasing energy as light
as opposed to releasing it as heat

Light exctes electrons in pigments
	Absorbed light excites electrons
	Fates for excited electrons:
		- Drop back down to a lower energy fluorescence.
		- Drop back down to a lower energy heat
		- Excite an electron in a nearby pigment and induce resonance.
		- Transferred to an electron acceptor in a redox reaction -> happens in the center of a photosystem

long hydrocarbon tail sticks chlorophyll in the membrane

proteins + chlorophyll molecules = photosystem
	called a light harvesting complex
	when coming down from being excited, they pass the energy to neighboring chlorophyll molecules
		this keeps getting passed aroung to the reaction-center of the photosystem
		a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules here pass out an electron
		in the complex is a high energy electron center that takes it, and starts an electron chain reaction
where does the system get this electron back?
	this is amazing and still not very well understood
	only chloroplasts can do this
	it gets it from a molecule of water!!
		water gets split into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons
		this is why plants need water lol
		this is where the oxygen comes from in photosynthesis!

note that photosystem 2 works first (they were just named in the order they were discovered!)

![[Pasted image 20241023092751.png]]
dont have to know the names of any of this stuff
do need to know that when light hits the system, electrons get excited, ATP is generated thru an ATP synthase enzyme powered by a hydrogen ion gradient
note that water is required at the start!

What process/system can be used to synthesize ATP during photosynthesis?
a. Photophosphorylation
*b. Photosystem II & ETC*
c. Photosystem I
d. Cyclic photophosphorylation

If the light reactions of photosynthesis capture energy in ATP and NADPH, why bother synthesizing glucose?
a. Longer term energy storage
b. Synthesis of structural components
c. Glucose and its products are biochemical precursors for other important molecules
*d. All of the above*

Which accurately describes the pathway of electrons in Non-Cyclic Electron Flow of photosynthesis?
a. Water to Photosystem I to Photosystem II to NADP+
b. NADPH to Photosystem I to Photosystem II to O2
*c. Water to Photosystem II to Photosystem I to NADP+*
d. NADPH to Photosystem II to Photosystem I to O2

# Calvin Cycle Summary
- uses energy of ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into sugars
- reduction of CO2
- Summary Equation for one glucose:
	6CO2 + 12 ATP + 6 NADPH -> C6H12O6 + 6ADP + 6 Pi + 6 NADP+
- this is endergonic!

# Output of Calvin Cycle
- Glucose is not a direct product of the Calvin cycle
- G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) is a 3-carbon sugar
	- Used to form sucrose.
		- major transport sugar in plants
		- disaccharide made of fructose and glucose
	- Used to make starch
		- insoluble glucose polymer
		- stored for later use

# Three phases of Calvin cycle
1.  Cinarbon fixation
	- RuBP + CO2 -> PGAin


carbon gets added on to make G3P in the calvin cycle
6 cycles fixes enough carbon to make a molecule of glucose

# Energy cycle
- photosythesis uses the products of respiration as starting substrates
- respiration uses the products of photosynthesis as starting substrates
- producction of glucose from G3P even uses part of the ancient glycolytic pathway, run in reverse
- Principal proteins involved in electron transport and ATP production in plants are evolutionarily related to those in the mitochondria
