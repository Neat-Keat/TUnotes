read 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 for 1st assignment
each chapter ends with a chapter review
	START HERE

today: 5 core concepts
	Chemical and physical laws
	structure determines function
	energy transformations
	information transactions
	evolution

end of chapter Q's are different from what's on quizzes, but are still good review

reading assignments:
	ch1 and ch2 readings are open, due end of the day Tuesday

quizzes

What makes something "alive"?
1. Cellular organization
2. Ordered complexity
3. Sensitivity
4. Growth, development, and reproduction
5. Energy utilization
6. Homeostasis
7. Evolutionary adaptaion

viruses dont count bc they
1. arent organized with cells
2. cant reproduce without a host

Hierarchical Organization
- cellular level
	- atoms > molecules > macromolecule (like DNA) > cells > organelles
	- cells are the basic unit of life
- Organismal level
	- tissues, organs, organ systems, whole organism
- populational level
	- population, ommunity
- ecosystem level
- biosphere
	- Earth is an example

each level has *emergent properties* 
	novel properties arising from the way in which components interact. Emergent properties often cannot be deduced solely from the knowledge of the individual components
	- "life" is an emergent property - the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
	- Emergent properties are the reason "life" defies a simple definition
	- Examples: heart, bicycle
	- can you think of other examples??
		TLDR: the functions of the whole isn't what you'd expect from examining the parts

*compound* 
	2 elements that come together
		NaCl is table salt
			Na is a metal, and Cl is a poisonous gas
			you wouldn't expect them to make something so tasty

Discuss
	Fire consumes energy. It responds to the environment. It can grow, and even reproduce. Yet we do not consider fire to be alive. Why not?
		- no cellular organization

Core Concepts in Biology
	Life is subject to chemical and physical laws
		- Biological systems follow known chemical properties, such as molecular bonding.
		- Properties of physics, such as thermodynamics, are also key determining factors of biological systems.
	Structure Determines Function
		Know a function - look for that structure in other organisms
		Examples
			> receptor on human cell for insulin known.
			> find similar molecule in a worm.
			> might conclude this molecule functions the same in the worm.
	All life constantly requires energy
		Energy enters environments in one form, typically as solar energy, and is constantly transformed by organisms
			- Photosynthetic organisms transform solar energy into chemical energy as matter (carbohydrates)
			- other organisms, humans included...
	Living Systems Depend on Information Transactions
		- DNA
		- Sequence of 4 nucleotides encode cell's info
			- CTAG
		- Gene - discrete unit of info
		- Genome - entire set of DNA instructions
		- Continuity of life depends on faithful copying of DNA into daughter cells
		- DNA's sequence -> RNA -> proteins
			-this process is called the *Central Dogma of Biology* 
		Information Transactions
			Info in DNA used to direct synthesis of cellular components
				- contrl of gene expression leads to different cells/tissue...
				- ...
	Evolution Explains the Unity and Diversity of Life
		- ALL organisms today descended from a simple creature 3.5 BYA
		- some characteristics preserved - like use of DNA
		- Conservation reflects that they have a fundamental role
