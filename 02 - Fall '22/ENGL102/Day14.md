From McGuire (2017) Students push for "real food" at TU:
 
"Many large industrial farms use migrant labor, and they work under slave-like conditions," said Barohona. "We want to make sure the workers and the farmers have good pay, working conditions, and worker's rights."
 
To use this quote you need to:
 
1) cite BOTH Barahona AND McGuire  
2) contextualize Barohana  
3) cut the "said Barahona" and replace it with an ellipsis (…)
 
According to Towson University graduate assistant Kevin Barahona, "Many large industrial farms use migrant labor, and they work under slave-like conditions...We want to make sure the workers and the farmers have good pay, working conditions, and worker's rights" (as quoted in McGuire, 2017).

Terry Acree, a professor of Food Science Technology at Cornell University, claims that "A natural flavor...is a flavor that's been derived with an out-of-date technology" (as quoted in Schlosser, 2006, p. 26).
