"REAL FOOD" article thoughts
 
Pros:  
Benefits producer, consumer, community, and earth  
Vague requirements?  
Buying local means you don't have to worry about preservatives  
Cons:  
14-20% higher costs for university/students  
That’s a lot more money, could turn away future students  
Student advocates aren't necessarily representative of the school as a whole
 
Kim Schatzel hasn't currently implemented the plan  
TU has 2% "real food", RFC aims for 20% minimum  
"real food" stations around campus as a pilot program has been suggested
 
Personally, I think it's a good idea, but the logistics of actually executing it while keeping  
everything affordable is the biggest concern and should be absolutely addressed before implementation. I don't want a sudden 20% increase in meal plans because of a program I didn't even necessarily support before learning about it today. Students needed support from higher ups, but were getting dono-walled.

"Real Food" = good for the Producer – cost effective, good working conditions, sustainability  
Consumer – healthy, affordable, tasty  
Community – local economy  
Earth – environmental issues, sustainability, transportation, burning fossil fuels, climate change
