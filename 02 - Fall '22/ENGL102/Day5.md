Every truth claim needs a citation, even if it's from the same source back to back

Notes in the text = in-text citations

|---|---|
|QUOTE|Copy exact words  <br>Quotation marks + citation. (name, year, p.#)|
|CITE|Give credit to source  <br>Necessary for quotes + Paraphrases  <br>(name, year) in APA  <br>(name, year, p#) in MLA|
 
This means that quoting an article in a journal requires the page range of BOTH the entire article AND the quote

WHEN DO YOU NEED TO CITE??  
Every time it's not your original idea  
When it's NOT common knowledge  
Common knowledge is:  
1) audience dependent  
2) not everything on the internet is CK  
3) When in doubt, cite

DO NOT QUOTE EVERY SENTENCE 4HEAD  
Expectations differ by discipline
