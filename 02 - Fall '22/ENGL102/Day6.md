SCHEDULE CHANGES (check BB)
 
Feeback on 1st draft by 9/29  
2nd Draft due by 10/6  
I think lol

Write the body, then go BACK and write/ rewrite intro + conclusion  
You can write a "shit intro" if you need one to get started, but go back over it later
 
Be willing to throw out some parts of your writing
 
PLAN CHANGES BEFORE READING MOTT-SMITHS COMMENTS
 
2nd draft is NOT just "do what the teacher wants lol"
 
Add in-text citations and references if you havent already
 
THEN read instructor's comments on the first draft  
You can:  
Take the advice and change your paper  
Resist your advice and be ready to **explain why you didn't use it**  
Highlight comments and ask Writing Center tutors how to apply the advice
 
Read over the paper AGAIN, and make necessary changes again
 
When you think its good, reread AGAIN, but out loud  
(mandatory apparently)  
Check places that are hard to read and make them more readable  
If you struggle, so will your reader
 
Last thing: proofread

Just read the doc on BB lol

"We aren't students, we're authors"

You don’t HAVE to take advice, you have to explain why you don’t though

2nd draft is graded on:  
**Persuasiveness**  
Writing  
Directions  
Ownership  
Revision

SLOW FOOD:  
In class activity
