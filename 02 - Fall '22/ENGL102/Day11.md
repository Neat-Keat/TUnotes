SCHOLARLY ARTICLES ARE PUBLISHED IN A PROFESSIONAL JOURNAL  
Written by scholars, read by scholars
 
SCIENTIFIC FACTS /= SCHOLARLY
 
Wikis are platforms where anyone can edit  
Rely on the logic of crowdsourcing  
Crowdsourcing is being increasingly accepted by scientists
 
"feel free to use wikipedia in this class"  
"use wikipedia to start, but don’t you dare use it to finish"
 
Articles in academic databases are scholarly

BALANCED /= BIASED  
Bias is about deception  
Skewing the facts to support a claim  
Lying by omission is still lying in academic writing  
Good academic writers don’t deceive their audience  
Ignoring the other side of the story is cherry-picking  
Not academic writing  
Academic thinkers change their position according to the evidence  
Framing can contribute to bias  
Any 1 text isnt bias, multiple texts can lead to bias  
Drug runners from Columbia as a stereotype  
Valid in 1 movie, not in 20  
Legit times to choose framing:  
BLM vs All Lives Matter  
BLM /= all lives DON'T matter, but that historically, Black Lives have been undervalued > gives authors a frame to work under  
Bias is hard to understand
