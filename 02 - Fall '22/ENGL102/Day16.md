Unit 2 paper assigned
 
NOT what YOU think of GMOs, what the UN thinks
 
Use AT LEAST 4 source texts, 5 pages
 
COVER LETTERS:  
Should be different for each draft, write about specifics, not generalizations
 
Write cover letter to your Writing partner!
 
How to structure intro?  
1 way:  
Introduce topic of GMOs, 1st patented life, etc. (GMOs quick rise to normalcy?)  
Introduce conflict (GMOs good for companies vs environment) (who's on each side?) (outline issues)  
Given this disagreement, ill look at what the UN thinks, and ill use these documents to explain why they think that  
"the UN supports/ doesn’t support GMOs"
 
Into bodies of support  
NO 1st person pronouns (no extraneous "I think", only use it to differentiate from someone else's opinion)
 
Can use outside sources if properly vetted  
Shouldn’t need to
 
Be careful to stay in the same, modern time period
 
Use square brackets to change his to [their]
 
Discuss both sides and be as complete as possible
 
DOC WAS WRITTEN BEFORE GMOS!!!  
How can it be interpreted?
