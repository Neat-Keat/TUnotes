CAFO  
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation  
Overcrowded, covered in manure  
1 cow gets sick, they all get sick  
Rain causes manure to runoff into crop fields, contaminating crops
 
We feed cows corn because its cheap  
Government subsidies  
Agribusinesses lobby for corn subsidies (cheap corn = cheap beef)  
Results in overabundance of corn > new uses  
Animal feed, diapers, batteries, HFCS, ethanol, ibuprofen  
Extra corn is dumped to other countries  
NAFTA means CAN and MEX corn farmers goes out of business  
MEX migrant workforce in the US, hired by Agribusinesses that put them out of work
 
Farmers go in lots of debt, and as a result get put under Tyson's thumb and have to do whatever they want
