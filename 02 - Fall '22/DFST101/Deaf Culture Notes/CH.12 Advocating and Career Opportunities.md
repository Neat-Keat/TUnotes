"Advocacy refers to the act or process of pleading, supporting, or recommending a cause or a person"
 
"It is important that these hearing people who endeavor to be allies do not participate in advocacy efforts out of pity or as interfering individuals but rather out of conviction that Deaf people can benefit from this collaborative advocacy in order to counteract discrimination and oppression"
 
Successful allies are "sensitive to one’s biases, whether for Deaf or hearing cultural aspects, willing to acknowledge cross-cultural conflicts and improve themselves, show true commitment to achieving equality, and empathic understanding of hearing dominance tendencies"
