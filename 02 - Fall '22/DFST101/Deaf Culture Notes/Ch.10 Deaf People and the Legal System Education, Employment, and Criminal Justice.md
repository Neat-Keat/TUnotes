"The 1st Amendment provides them with freedom of speech. The 4th Amendment shields them from unreasonable searches and taking of belongings. The 5th Amendment provides protection from self-incrimination and the right to remain silent when questioned by police or detectives. The 6th Amendment provides the right to have an attorney, a speedy and public trial, and a trial by jury; to present a defense; and to confront the accuser and witnesses. And the 14th Amendment provides the right to due process ensuring suspects and defendants have safeguards when encountering officials throughout the criminal justice system"

"In a sample of 97 Deaf individuals who were incarcerated in the Estelle Unit at Huntsville State Prison in Texas, 64% of the Deaf inmates had been convicted of violent crimes compared to 49% of the general hearing population. Sexual offenders made up 32.3% of the Deaf individuals compared to only 12.3% of the hearing prison population. Within the Deaf population, murder was committed by 10%, assault by 9%, robbery by 7%, and child injury by 3%"

"Because of poor educational practices they have had to endure, Deaf individuals who become suspects and defendants of crimes often do not have the language to defend themselves in hearings or trials. They are forced to sign documents and waivers such as Miranda and the plea-bargain without understanding them. They do not know why they are incarcerated. When discharged, they do not understand how to follow the regulations of their probation and parole requirements (Vernon, 2010)."
