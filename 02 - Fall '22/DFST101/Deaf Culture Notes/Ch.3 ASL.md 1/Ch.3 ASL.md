144 sign languages documented worldwide  
Sign is studied thru comparative linguistics, computer & brain imaging technology, and lexicostatistics

Used natural French signing (old LSF), modified to conform w/ French grammar and new signs.  
Called the "French Method"  
Made it to America in the 19th century  
Controversial in France, favored natural signing  
Students became teachers and passed on the French Method  
Laurent Clerc, a student, along with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet formed the first US public school for the deaf

Later invited to INJS, where LSF was used  
Established Connecticut Asylum (at Hartford) for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, now the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut with Clerc

![In a study with 96 Black deaf adults from six different sites around the coun- try, using focus groups, interviews, and storytelling, Carolyn McCaskill and her colleagues (McCaskill, Lucas, Bayley, & Hill, 2011) found that older Black signers used more two-handed signs, more forehead level signs, and a larger signing space than the younger Black deaf signers and white deaf sign- ers. They used less mouthing and a different vocabulary or lexicon. The young Black signers showed no differ- ence in the amount of mouthing or of sign space, as did the white signers, but young Black signers incorporated more Black English (African American English) into their signing. You may be interested in surfing the Internet for examples of Black ASL including STOP TRIPPING (i.e., stop imagin- ing), DANG (i.e., darn), and slap 5 (i.e., high- five). ](Exported%20image%2020240525202842-0.png)

"Ongoing debate that still exists in the 21st century with some supporting the use of ASL and others supporting the use of the “methodological signs” or manual codes of English that follow English grammar (Lane, 1984)."

LANGUAGE CONTACT: when 2 languages talk to each other they change each other and can merge if for a long time  
This is how ASL formed

International Sign and Signed Langs used Globally  
International Sign (IS) was developed for intl. meetings  
NOT a full language  
Limited pidgin for cross-communication, like @ World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), International Congress on Education of the Deaf (ICED), and Deaflympics  
Incorporates elements mostly from European sign languages  
Accessible only to ASL signers or European signers  
British Sign Language  
Australian Sign Language  
New Zealand Sign Language  
American Sign Language  
All vastly different in culture, history, structure, etc.

ASL and English  
ASL uses iconicity and Modality  
Form + expression, basically  
Both have similar acquisition timetables, and use both brain hemispheres  
Spoken lang's articulators are in and around the mouth, as opposed to hands and arms  
Speech is faster, with less info/word  
ASL is slower, with more info/word  
English is linear  
ASL executes signs simultaneously?  
Means both convey ideas at the same speed
 
DeafBlind people use:  
Tactile Modality  
Braille  
Hands-on Signing  
Tadoma Method  
This uses tactile lipreading with the DeafBlind person feeling the vibration of the throat, face, and jaw positions of the speaker as he or she speaks  
Protactile  
has its own distinct system of classifiers, specific set of signs, and tactile listing or ranking
 
ASL has no formal written equivalent, but does have ASL glossing  
Doesn’t fully rep. ASL, and only uses capital letters  
No grammar or other important components  
Only really used in academic papers that analyze ASL
 
ASL lets you tell jokes, curse, pray, exchange news, tell stories, recite poetry, talk about philosophy, etc.  
Dorothy Sueoka Casterline created tab, dez, and dig fonts for written notation of ASL
 
ASL dictionaries exist lol (called DASL)  
TRUE-WAY ASL dictionary has +15,000 videos  
This only scratches the surface of ASL's vocab
 
Deaf Interpreters (DI)  
Used to water down complex, specialized topics (like medicine or neurobiology) into a form that can be conveyed to hearing audiences  
Often excluded b/c hearing interpreters get offended lol

4 Modalities of Communication:  
Tactile  
Auditory  
Visual-Gestural  
Writing  
Can be blended, as in the case of CODAs who both talk and sign  
Messes with grammar a bit lol

ASL was first linguistically described and analyzed by a Deaf-hearing team: Dorothy Sueoka Casterline, Carl G. Croneberg, and William C. Stokoe (1960). They founded the first ASL linguistic laboratory as well as Sign Language Studies, a journal that published ASL linguistic research. After their groundbreaking research, ASL was given academic status by linguists who then set up academic linguistic programs and research laboratories worldwide

Like spoken languages, ASL has a phonology, semantics or vocabulary, morphology, syntax or grammar, and discourse structures

Its phonology consists of the following parts of signs, which are the following: (1) handshape, (2) location, (3) movement, and (4) palm orientation. A fifth parameter of nonmanual signals (NMS) such as head tilts, eyebrow raises, and facial expressions is hotly debated.

CAT can be broken down into four phonemes, the handshape (F), the palm oriented toward the cheek, the location (thumb and index finger touching the cheek), and movement (brush index finger and thumb back toward ear, twice)

English has two main numerical systems, the cardinal numbers (one, two, three) and ordinal numbers (first, second, and third), while ASL has more than 20 different documented numerical systems

use space, movement, and direction to show relationships between signs  
(GRAMMAR)

ASL also has a complex verb system made up of special terms called classifier predicates, classifier handshapes, and locative verbs, currently called depicting verbs (Valli et al., 2011). Depicting verbs are signs that use handshapes to designate things, size, shape, or usage. For example, things shown in classifiers can be objects, people, animals, or vehicles. Shapes can include outlines, perimeters, surfaces, configurations, or gradients. Sizes can show largeness, smallness, relative size, and volume. Usage can involve movement paths, speed, and interactions

ASL also has a genderless pronoun (he, she, it) and a determiner system (i.e., the, a, an) that are made up of similar pointing signs. The auxiliary verbs in ASL (WILL, CAN, FINISH, MUST, SHOULD) are used at the beginning and at the end of the sentence instead of internally as in English. Also, ASL does not use prepositions in the same way that English does. ASL uses depicting verbs while English uses prepositions such as in, under, on, and so on

ASL uses facial grammar along with signs to mark time (NOW, FUTURE, LONG-TIME-AGO, PAST, FINISH) and movement, which are layered in the sign sentence.

ASL is more flexible, so it don’t always have to follow SVO

ASL has a rich reservoir of storytelling, poetry, nursery rhymes, drama, humor, and folklore, which has been passed down from generation to generation at Deaf schools and festivals and has been recorded on video, YouTube, and films

Manual alphabet is both ASL and English???  
Leads to loan words  
Used to teach vocab  
Expands concepts  
Spell words  
Identify stuff w/o sign equivalents  
Deaf children "babble" fingerspelled handshapes similar to hearing children  
Takes adults less than an hour to learn  
Takes longer to read and produce quickly and accurately
 
SOCIAL ASL v ACADEMIC ASL  
ASL math lulw  
ASL science lulw  
Both use a specialized vocab
 
Hearing students may find the facial grammar of ASL challenging such as executing question forms and negation. Other problematic areas include learning to form handshapes, using space, understanding ASL sentence structure, reading fingerspelling, using eye contact, and codeswitching between ASL and English

dialects are related to sociolinguistic factors such as how old you are, your socioeconomic class, your gender, your ethnic background, where you live, your sexual orientation, and whether you have a disability or not

ENGLISH AND ASL INFLUENCE EACH OTHER  
Lipreading  
Mouthing words  
Contact signing  
Blend of ASL signs and English word order
 
Other modes of communication are not languages or dialects per se but sign codes or systems of English whose elements are derived from ASL signs but then invent signs and morphemes and place them in English word order. These include the Total Communication (TC) philosophy and English-based systems such as Manual Codes of English (MCE), Simultaneous Communication (SimCom), and Cued Speech (CS)
 
LINGUISTIC IMPERIALISM  
"my language is better than yours"  
signing was banned from schools for Deaf students in the United States and worldwide  
Punishing Deaf students for signing as well as firing Deaf teachers from faculty positions.
