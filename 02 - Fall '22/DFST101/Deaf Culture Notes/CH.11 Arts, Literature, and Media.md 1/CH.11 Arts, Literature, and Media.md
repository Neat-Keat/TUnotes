"Hearing people learning sign language often think it is fun to translate songs written in English to ASL, often with good intentions, but they do not realize that this practice is offensive."
 
"One rule of interpreting ethics is to always facilitate interpretation between parties involving nonsigners and Deaf signers, so the interpreter should not be answering questions about their work."
 
"completed interpreting work is always confidential; hence, the interpreter should not be discussing (or answering questions) about specific experiences with previous interpreting jobs"
 
"Performance interpreting is not a vehicle for interpreters to become performers, but rather a vehicle for the target audience members to enjoy the performance event”
 
**LITERATURE**
 
**Literature in the Deaf Community**
 
"deep-seated systemic racism and other forms of -isms practiced by white Deaf communities have erased, ignored, and suppressed the preservation and documentation of Black ASL literature in the Black Deaf communities"

Film can preserve deaf stories  
Ranges from poetry, legends, riddles, folklore, jokes, fairytales, expositions, English to ASL translations, personal anecdotes, sign play, percussion songs, rap, fables, tall tales, epics, humorous, visual vernacular (mimery)  
￼ASL poetry has handshape rhyming, movement rhyming, location rhyming, palm orientation rhyming, nonmanual signal rhyming, handedness rhyming
 
Successful ASL literature includes these "essential features":

1. Using SL to narrate
2. Narrator knows the audience and works well with them
3. Narrator has a distinctive storytelling style (like a signature?)
4. Narrator is competent in weaving cadence into the story
5. Narrator incorporates rhyme and rhythm
6. Narrator follows patterns established in the genre
7. Story revolves around oppression and/or celebration of Deaf Culture
8. Uses particular literary devices to smuggle in representation of oppression
 
Themes of resistance and resilience  
Themes of Deaf conquering over hearing people
 
"This narration focuses on the daily frustrations of Deaf people, integrated with self-deprecating humor. Hearing people cannot tell stories like this, because they would be making fun of Deaf people and their experience, deeply disrespecting Deaf people and their lived experiences. Only members of the Deaf community culture are allowed to engage in self-deprecating humor about being deaf for different reasons, including group solidarity, cultural pride, and unity."
