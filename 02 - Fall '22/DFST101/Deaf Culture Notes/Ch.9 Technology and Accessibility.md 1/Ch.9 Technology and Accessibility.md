Accessibility: enabling access for a wider range of people
 
History: Foundations for Access
 
Accessibility movement in the US started when?  
Early 1800's, disabled people were forced to enter institutions/asylums or used in circuses as "freak shows"  
Some disabled people were sterilized so they didn’t make disabled babies - eugenics  
Before WWII and Nazi Germany, ~70,000 Americans were sterilized, without consent and/or knowledge  
1960s = major shift in American public thinking  
Civil rights and desegregation  
Architectural Barriers Act of 1968  
Lyndon B Johnson said that facilities built by the govt MUST be accessible  
Continued into the 70's  
1973 = 1973 Nixon signed the Rehabilitation act  
Prohibited federal and federally funded agencies to discriminate on the basis of disability in the hiring process  
Also provided civil rights to children and the disabled, including reasonable accommodations  
1975 = 1975 Public Law 94-142, Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Gerald Ford)  
1990 = ADA (George HW Bush)  
2013, Deaf and HH truck drivers were allowed to get commercial Drivers Licenses thru US Dept of Transportation  
2014, PNU forced to allow a Deaf medical student in their program  
2015, Harvard and MIT sued for vids w/o closed captions, Girl Scout troop ordered to have interpreter  
2017, movie theaters require closed captions
 
1990s introduced Universal Design to architecture
 
CAPTIONS  
Captions /= subtitles, captions include both speech AND SFX, subtitles just speech
 
ABC news: 1st captioned show for 10 years  
National Captioning Institute (NCI) created in 1979
 
1984 Democratic and Republican national conventions were captioned in real time
 
Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990, all TVs 13 inches or bigger require a caption-decoding microchip
 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, required digital tv receivers also include caption technology
 
Closed Captions vs Open Captions  
CC requires turning it on/off manually  
OC permanently included in video itself
 
"Other public venues with accessibility issues may include movie theaters, concerts, planetariums, demonstrations, and theatrical performances"
 
Open captions are expensive for hollywood to make and distribute, so they don’t  
They also thought Captions would drive away hearing customers, even without their opinion on the matter being taken
 
Most theaters use a seat-based caption system called Rear Window Caption (RWC) and CaptiView. Wearable glasses come in close second. Both have a plethora of issues
 
Current ADA interpretation DOES NOT require movies to present open captions
 
Netflix sued bc not ALL of their streaming movies were captioned, or captioned correctly  
Netflix and NAD agreed to caption everything, and Amazon, Apple, Gogo, Hulu, and Vudu followed.  
YouTube has auto captions and can take scripts and auto time them to video
 
Telephones  
For a long time, Deaf people relied on hearing people to call for them.  
1st phone amplifier in 1930's  
No privacy lol  
1st volume control in 1964  
Teletypewriter in 1960s  
Callers type message on TTY, receiver reads it and types back (basically text)  
Originally heavy, difficult to find, expensive, etc  
1968, only 25 machines  
1974, 7,000 machines worldwide, nearly all in Deaf homes  
DIDN’T work with regular phones
 
Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS)  
Hearing people at a center receive TTY calls and relay to the regular end  
1980s, newer, smaller, ergonomic TTYs  
Amplifier handsets for public phones  
Some phones worked with hearing aids  
1990, ADA passed, nationwide relay service available 24/7 in EVERY state + territory  
TTYs replaced by instant messaging  
IP Relay Service: anyone with internet access could call thru the web, NOT 911  
2008, FCC required all relay services to connect to 911  
2014, FCC required text-to-911 to be more widely available
 
Voice Carryover (VCO), Deafs with understandable speech can talk, but people still type to them
 
Hearing Carryover (HCO), opposite of VCO
 
1995, first test of Video Relay Services (VRS), callers connect to interpreter who relays sign to spoken English and back again.  
Inclusive to D and DD, but not DB  
IP Relay Services shut down bc they weren't profitable, so DB were up a creek w/o a paddle
 
Sweden provided VRS first in 1997, US 2nd in 2000, and now worldwide
 
ALERTING DEVICES OR SYSTEMS  
Tactile doorbell from 1956  
Drop a heavy ass weight on the floor LMAO  
Now transmitters can attach to doorbells and just flash the lights or vibrate a device  
Apple watches vibrate and can communicate info  
Pets can also alert if someone's at the door  
Or you can just text them lul  
VRS devices had red flashing lights and missed calls lists  
Computers and smartphones can vibrate or send notifications
 
WAKE-UP DEVICES  
Connect lamps or vibrating boxes to a clock (or smartwatches lmao)
 
BABY ALERTING DEVICES  
Baby monitors since 1937 (radio unit lol)  
Sleep wit da babies  
1970s, light based baby monitors  
1990s, video cams  
Blessing for Deaf community  
DBs have vibrating pagers like at a restaurant lol
 
RESIDENTIAL SECURITY AND ALARM SYSTEMS  
Home security can use color coded lights or vibrations  
Advanced systems can text phones  
Home fire and smoke alerts are strobe-based and vibrating systems  
Ring is popular with Deaf people
 
EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENTS  
FCC requires TV broadcasters (including emergency news providers!) include captions or visual display of info along w/ programming.
 
Weather warning systems traditionally over radio by NOAA  
Modified radio receivers provide texty based (and braille!) info
 
Strobe lights on civil defense sirens  
Text and email
 
ASSISTIVE SYSTEMS AND DEVICES  
"There are many variations of assistive systems and devices to help eliminate background noise and amplify the speech of people who are talking"

- Audio Loop Systems
- AM systems
- FM Systems
- Infrared Systems

All have:

1. A transmitter carrying spoken info from speaker to receiver
2. A receiver that receives info and amplifies sound levels for recipient
 
VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING (VRI)  
Temp solution when interpreters arent available  
Sign to interpreter in the TV, they relay to hearing participant on the other end  
Best used w/ a limited amount of adults and simple convos  
Not accessible for DB, young, foreigns or those who don’t understand ASL OR English  
Many orgs are unfamiliar with VRI setup  
Requires high speed internet
 
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY  
Instant messaging  
UbiDuo2 shady business?  
Don’t comm with deaf community but sells $2,000 equipment as "the best translator for the deaf comm".  
Cardzilla, type on your phone, but big so passing it to someone else makes it easy to read  
Speech recognition software  
Rocky start in 2000s, improved considerably  
Very useful for blind consumers, not deaf  
Text-to-speech however, is super useful!  
Sign language recognition apps are being developed, not very accurate rn
 
Motion capture can make ASL avatars relay info
 
The ASL App is like a pocket dictionary of common signs, developed by a Deaf  
Signily is a text messaging keyboard entirely in sign using photos of handshapes and gifs for moving signs such as yes or no, also developed by a Deaf  
Includes English translations online  
Hopes to be in Unicode  
￼AR can replace audio tours  
Can turn english based stories bilingual
 
SignGlasses  
Glasses that you wear, with the speaker wearing a mic, and a live interpreter showing up on the inside of your glasses  
Allows Deaf students to look at their laptop, write down notes, and pour a cylinder into a test tube without having to look for the interpreter
 
"Public schools funded by taxpayers proliferated in the 1940s and 1950s, and students that did not fit the general population were put in “special classes” within the school. Those special classes often included deaf, blind, cognitively challenged, and students with other disabilities who were grouped together in one class (Winzer, 2009)."

"ADA is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, including requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and accessibility requirements for public accommodations"

"There were and are several captioning organizations established, with some renamed over the decades, including Captioned Films for the Deaf, Captioned Films and Videos, Captioned Media Program, The Caption Center, Tripod Captioned Films, Movie Access Coalition, Media Access Group, and Coalition for Movie Captioning"

Open-captioned film prints (where open captions are permanently embedded in the film itself) are favored by most members of the Deaf community because the format is most similar to captions on television (King, 2009)

Preferred accessibility devices

"the invention of the telephone was the most formidable, social, and cultural obstacle for the Deaf community (DeVinney, 2015)."

A nonprofit organization, Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc., was established in 1968 to handle the distribution of TTYs and maintain a national directory of TTY numbers for Deaf people, companies, and schools.

In the latter half of the 2000s, rampant misuse of VRS services by the service providers themselves resulted in over seven VRS service provider closures and 26 arrests and convictions.
 
"would knowingly place fraudulent calls in order to increase the amount of reimbursement from the government. This cost the government millions of dollars"

"Typical ways Deaf people get each other’s attention without a doorbell include banging hard on the door with the fist or the heel, waving and shining a light through windows, or moving a piece of paper underneath a door"

"In 2017, when Hurricane Irma was nearing Florida, officials announced a mandatory evacuation, with the interpreter signing “pizza” and “bear monster.” The NAD chief executive, Howard A. Rosenblum said, “It was atrocious,” referring to the inept interpreter (Caron, 2017)."

"Some people, not fully understanding the concept of VRI, attempt to use VRS services while both parties (the deaf person and the hearing nonsigner) are in the same location. If the VRS interpreter notices both are in the same room, the interpreter will then terminate the call due to FCC regulations, as federal taxes are collected for facilitating phone calls between deaf and hearing people, not to interpret between deaf and hearing people in the same room."
