Deaf Culture and Multiculturalism  
Deaf education has historically ignored Deaf input, including their organizations  
Deaf adults are underrepresented in teaching positions across the board
 
FACTORS IMPACTING SCHOOLING  
AGE OF ONSET AND PARENTAL HEARING STATUS
 
The age at which a child becomes Deaf affects schooling  
Deaf before 2: benefits from a "strong visual language foundation"  
Deaf at 5-6: recover lost lang thru speechreading instruction and auditory training  
DeafBlind + DeafDisabled individuals need to be treated on a case-by-case basis
 
Deaf children with Deaf parents THRIVE in ASL + English bilingual school environments  
The 95% of other Deaf children may struggle with lang access  
They may experience:  
ASL  
Total Communication philosophy  
Manual Codes of English  
They're usually expected to learn both a SL and English
 
MULTILINGUALISM, MULTICULTURALISM, AND SCHOOLING
 
19.4%-35% of the US Deaf population don’t use English OR ASL in the home  
19% speak Spanish
 
Its difficult for Deaf learners to pick up on tonal differences in languages like Chinese
 
Plains Indian Sign Language region (PISL)  
Includes Northern Cheyenne, Crow, and Kiowa
 
Being overly demonstrative can be considered inappropriate in Asian countries, get fucked signers  
Some see disability as a divine punishment, so they go to faith healers + pilgrimages to "heal"
 
LGBT Deaf students  
Vulnerable to psychological and emotional stress  
From both sexual orientation confusion and parental rejection  
Vulnerable to:  
Lower self-esteem  
Depression  
Negative perceptions of school climate  
Lower grades  
School absences  
And more
 
DeafDisabled Students  
Includes Deaf individuals with:  
Intellectual Disabilities (IDs)  
Down syndrome  
ADD  
ADHD  
Social Disabilities  
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)  
Emotional/Behavioral Disturbances (EDs)  
Mood disorders  
Depression  
Etc.  
Physical/ Sensory disabilities  
Cerebral Palsy (CP)  
Orthopedic Impairments  
Blindness/Low Vision  
Syndromes:  
CHARGE  
Treacher-Collins  
Waardenburg  
Usher  
Deaf individuals w/ Usher Syndrome have their own culture and use a protactile lang
 
Deaf Education usually is NOT accessible or incorporate Universal Design (UD)  
40%-50% of Deaf Students have disabilities that can impact learning
 
COMMUNICATION AND LANG APPROACHES￼HISTORY OF DEAF EDUCATION  
Manual-Oral Controversy  
Historical and present friction between signers and non-signers/oralists  
Deaf hiring practices are still rooted in racism, sexism, audism, linguicism, and white privilege  
1st public Oral School in Germany in the 18th century, ALONGSIDE 1st ASL schools, so Oralism was still a main methodology being taught. 1st by Samuel Hienicke
 
1880: International Deaf Education conference in Milan, Italy voted to ban SL in schools
 
E.M. Gallaudet and Graham Bell argued a lot lol  
Led to E.M. developing "the combined approach" that used both speech and sign  
Signing became more allowed in schools, but mostly with older students and as a way to control behavior than a way to teach lang  
Young Deaf children were segregated into manual and oral classrooms
 
Babbidge Report (1965)  
Documented the failures of deaf education  
Signing became more popular in schools  
This + the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Education of all Handicapped Children (1975) led to the improvement of deaf education
 
Rubella epidemic from 1960s to 80s  
Lots of Deaf children, especially w/ other disabilities were born
 
1970s-80s, sign language linguistic research boomed  
1980s-90s, bilingual-bicultural approach emerged as a teaching approach for K-12  
1988, Deaf President Now + 1st bi-bi school, Learning Center for the Deaf in Framingham, MA  
Bi-bi caught on rapidly after this, and the Deaf community accepted it enthusiastically  
Old concept, just more credible b/c of new theories/concepts in the hearing world lol
 
1970s-now, mainstreaming Deaf children dominates over proper Deaf education  
"However, now mainstreaming Deaf students into public schools became a parent’s right mandated by federal law"  
Leads to an influx of ASL and translation programs (more interpreters than ever)  
1990s - Cochlear Implants reach the forefront
 
"War against sign language" spearheaded by the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing  
Advances in hearing aid tech means kids that don’t use them successfully AND aren't exposed to SL are STILL getting deprived of lang and cognition  
AG Bell Association still collaborates with ASL supporting orgs tho?
 
BILINGUAL AND MULTILINGUAL APPROACHES
 
The CRUX is that ASL is the lang of instruction and English is taught as a 2nd lang  
English can mean mostly a focus of print, may include speaking for those w/ residual hearing
 
BLENDED APPROACHES
 
Includes Total Communication (TC), Simultaneous Communication (SimCom), contact signing, Manual codes of English (MCE), or cued speech (CP)
 
MCE usually results in endings getting chopped off, and may not make sense to those w/o a foundation in English (may also overload a child's cognitive and perceptual processes?)
 
All these methods are easier for hearing parents to acquire
 
MONOLINGUAL LISTENING AND SPOKEN LANGUAGE (LSL) APPROACHES  
Used w/ oral Deaf children  
An offshoot is the auditory-verbal approach, which uses lipreading  
Historically known as pure oralism/ auditory stimulation, the multisensory/syllable unit method, and the language association-element method, and the unisensory or aural approach  
(isnt this the bad one?)
 
COMMUNICATION APPROACES AND DEAFDISABLED STUDENTS  
DD students may benefit from the same comm. And lang. Approaches as Deaf students, but with repetition and additional time to acquire concepts and lang structures  
They may use a SL, protactile SL, spoken lang, or some combination  
May also use tangible objects, raised drawings, gestures, pictures, and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)  
Unaided ACC employs graphic symbols, sign language, fingerspelling, objects, large print, and tactile communication  
Aided ACC uses electronic and nonelectronic devices like communication boards and computer displays  
Can be traced back to the use of manual alphabets and signs recorded in EU from the 16th century, + North American Native Indian SL  
Deaf children w/ emotional/behavioral disabilities + those w/ autism use all three, but may need to be taught on social responses, like eye contact, turn-taking, and reducing highly rigid & repetitive behaviors
 
Due to physical facial anomalies, Deaf children w/ Treacher Collins syndrome will need speech and lang services
 
Those w/ CHARGE syndrome have a variety of sensory disabilities ( coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the nasal passages, retardation of physical growth, and ear abnormalities, along with cognitive delays.
 
Deaf children w/ meningitis may have learning difficulties, neuromotor disorders, seizure disorders, visual disorders, & behavioral problems, along w/ cognitive delays.
 
Deaf Children w/ Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may also have cognitive, visual, and motor delays and experience progressive decreasing of hearing levels, all of which impacts ideal method of education
 
SCHOOL SETTINGS  
CENTER SCHOOLS  
Provide comprehensive programming, including academic, vocational, sports, and other after-school activities.
 
Most states have a state school for the Deaf that is free  
They provide a critical mass of Dead adult role models for lang and cultural modeling.
 
29.6% of ALL deaf/ hard-of-hearing students attend state/center schools  
Deaf Children WITH disabilities may be included in classes with Deaf children WITHOUT disabilities
 
PRIVATE ORAL SCHOOLS  
Children live on campus, are forced to learn to speak, and are expected to integrate w/ hearing schools by 9th grade. Charge tuition
 
DAY SCHOOLS  
Deaf students have their own classrooms in a public school setting  
Abt 68.9% of children were educated in separate classrooms in public schools and spent less than 40% of time with non-disabled peers
 
INCLUSION  
Deaf Students are integrated w/ hearing students  
No guarantee the curriculum is accessible
 
MAINSTREAM, SELF-CONTAINED RESOURCE ROOM  
Abt. 13.9% of Deaf & hard-of-hearing students receive support services in resource rooms  
When theres only 1 Deaf student at a school, they have difficulty finding friends and social access. They also struggle establishing an identity and faced challenges in obtaining qualified interpreters
 
COENROLLMENT  
Have a critical mass of Deaf students in 1 classroom and provides a teacher w/ deaf education certification. Also a 2nd teacher who teaches the hearing children. As a team, the 2 instructors teach the same on-grade level content, and hearing students take sign language classes to communicate with deaf peers.  
"reverse mainstreaming"
 
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND HOME SCHOOLS  
Some use ASL and English Bilingual approaches, others use spoken lang approaches. About 3.7% are home schooled.  
Parents choose this so they can control the use of a specific communication approach + provide academic support and religious instruction.
 
TECHNOLOGY, DEAFSPACE, AND CLASSROOM ACOUSTICS  
DeafSpace: an aspect of Universal Design that aims to reduce architectural barriers for visual learning.  
Includes changing desk and chair arrangements to a semicircle where teacher and student have open visual access and adequate lighting.  
Acoustically treated classrooms can help too
 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) measures the level of a signal to the level of background noise
 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING  
Standards-based curriculum is bad because the target audience is white, middle-class, and hearing, and usually doesn’t accommodate Deaf and DeafDisabled student's needs.
 
EARLY CHILDHOOD (EC) LEVELS (Birth to 5)  
Each state has an early intervention system that's provided free of cost. Services are individualized  
Education for Deaf children is protected under a series of laws enacted at federal and state levels. They provide families and Deaf children w/ early access to communication, lang., and services from birth to age 21, then also into adulthood during post-secondary schooling, employment, and health care.  
LEAD-K campaing and Deaf Children's Bill of Rights
 
CHALLENGES IN SCHOOL  
Birth to 5 has Deaf children struggling with:  
Finding Deaf mentors and Deaf mentors of color  
Finding a family-centered intervention (FCEI) that takes a multicultural perspective and uses a bilingual interpreter  
Don’t trust medical professionals that don’t know the Deaf perspective, they'll force spoken language or whateva
 
K-12  
CURRICULUM AND OUTCOMES  
VITAL in Deaf student's cognitive, lang, and social development.  
Each state has its own curriculum, learning standards, and assessment measures  
Teachers may still find it difficult to adapt, differentiate, or modify them.  
Deaf children tend to score 3-4 years being hearing peers on standardized tests  
Gaps widen over time  
Deaf students complete high school @ lower rates compared to hearing students  
Deaf students w/ disabilities are 2x less likely to complete high school than non-disabled high school students
 
TRANSITION AND POSTSECONDARY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES  
After HS, Deaf students go on to postsecondary education, vocational education, employment, continuing and adult education, adult services, Independent living, or community participation.  
CURRICULUM AND OUTCOMES  
Deaf students are required by law to have a transition plan for post HS by age 14  
Eligible for services up to 22nd birthday  
Barriers to finding appropriate services include:  
Generic and superficial quality of appropriate transition training during high school, need for more time during transition training, inability to complete household chores and live independently w/ or w/o a roommate, and need for more time to complete transition training.
 
Academic and technical degrees and prep are provided by 4 colleges that enroll primarily Deaf students:  
Gallaudet University  
National Technical Institute of the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology  
California State University  
Southwest Collegiate Institute  
These colleges provide a bilingual signing environment with instructors immersed in deaf culture and proficient in ASL.  
￼CART: computer-assisted real-time captioning
 
Deaf college students are less racially diverse than hearing students
 
Deaf Latinx students have lower then avg. Edu attainment  
Deaf Asian students are most likely to complete bachelor degrees, but still show less achievement than hearing peers
 
Same sample: 20.8% have learning disabilities, 8.1% are DB, and 13.1% have ambulatory disabilities
 
POSTSECONDARY CHALLENGES  
Barriers in accessing work training, and finding/retaining employment after HS  
College students may need support services like protactile interpreting, extra time on tests, notetaking, writing centers, and tutoring to a greater extent  
￼PREPARATION OF TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL INTERPRETERS  
TEACHER-TRAINING  
3 types of comm approaches taught in teacher-training in deaf education:  
Bilingual  
Comprehensive  
Oral-aural  
Council for Exceptional Children (CEC)  
Council on Education of the Deaf (CED)  
Both jointly published a set of standards for teachers who work w/ Deaf students  
Some programs offer certifications and coursework  
Some programs require teachers to have dual certifications in deaf education and special education.  
Teachers in training can learn the bi-bi approach.  
Coursework in Deaf Culture, multiculturalism, ASL, and English bilingual theories, practices, and assessments.  
Lessons in ASL, and Oral/written English  
Assessments in ASL and English  
DEAF TEACHERS PROVIDE ROLE MODELS  
Private universities provide training in monolingual oral-aural approaches to teaching lulw
 
EDUCATIONAL INTERPRETER TRAINING  
The role of a qualified and certified educational interpreter is paramount
 
Interpreters are proficient in SL and translation techniques, have multicultural competency, knowledge about Deaf Culture and multiculturalism, and coursework in academic areas they cover
 
CHALLENGES FOR TEACHERS AND INTERPRETERS  
Developing a multicultural curriculum results in a multicultural faculty  
Deaf people get bullied :o  
"School administrators need to examine attitudes of low expectations where Deaf students of color and those with disabilities are tracked with less frequency in academics and tracked more often into vocational and special education classes compared to their white counterparts"

![clear patterns emerge, including a cycle that kept repeating itself: an anti- signing policy is evoked, an oral / manual debate ensues, and then Deaf community responds With calls for change. ](02%20-%20Fall%20'22/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-2.png)

![While Deaf students take longer to enroll in college (5 years) compared to hearing students (2 years), at least 51% complete at least some college. More Deaf men are enrolled in college (53.5%) com- pared to Deaf women (46.5%), but Deaf women have higher completing rates than Deaf men (Garberoglio et al., 2019). ](02%20-%20Fall%20'22/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-3.png)  

![Currently, teachers in training must take teacher certification exams. These pose a barrier for Deaf people who want to become teachers because English is often their second language. The irony is that state testing does not include a test in ASL (or ASL proficiency) for those who want to teach deaf children.
