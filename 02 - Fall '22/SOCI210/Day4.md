Conflict Theory:  
Identify groups, scarce resources, and the distribution of power  
Karl Marx (1818-1883)  
Bourgeoisie v Proletariat  
**Hegemony â€“ Antonio Gramsci**  
Dynamic relationship between dominant and subordinate groups that allows the dominant group to maintain power  
Tends to hyperfocus on social class and money  
Can be analyzed on both the micro and macro level  
Scarce resources can be anything  
Ex. Olympic-level athletes per country to show a power imbalance
 
Critical Theory:  
Examine particular issues/problems  
Race, gender, social class  
Sport in Context:  
Historical, Social, & Material Conditions  
How do they impact the issue in question?  
How has the NFL's hiring process changed over time?  
How does this reflect the US's worldview through time?  
How do uniforms, equipment, etc. Influence how athletes act?  
More protective gear > more aggressive games  
Can people use this to make "their idea of the perfect sport"?  
Researchers could potentially desire change/political involvement  
Ex. Alternatives are suggested  
Feminist Theory  
Explains society via an understanding of gender relations  
Ex. Liberal/ radical perspectives  
Social Class - Pierre Bordieu  
>Reproduction  
Middle Class parents raise Middle Class children  
(theory doesn't take into account individual agency to move up the social ladder)

Panopticon â€“ Michel Foucault  
Self- Surveillance in a prison  
Behave because you have to assume you're being watched  
Circular prison w/ watchtower in center ðŸ˜€  
idea of Big brother surveillance  
Term modified to fit sociology  
Athletes are constantly being watched, similar to a panopticon  
How does this influence behavior?  
Is there conditioning involved?  
Symbolic Interactionism:  
Society consists of shared meanings  
Focus on how people make sense of & give meaning to events of daily life  
Assume people are active beings, not passive (choice)  
People take initiative and have agency  
Why do high schoolers chose to be/not to be an athlete?  
Why do athletes choose the sport they do?  
What does it mean to be an athlete?

DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP  
Hegemony is tweaking  
this relationship to keep  
the hierarchy

Ex.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Coach||
|Varsity||
|JV||

Coach lets some JV players practice w/ V  
Coach lets some V players hang w/ coaches  
Both keep people content w/ their place
