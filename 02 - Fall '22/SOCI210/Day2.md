Sociologists Examine:  
The collective / social  
"Collective consciousness"  
Specifically the American view in this course  
Society as a social construct  
Social constructs wouldn't exist without a society  
Something people have created for people to participate in  
We've constructed it, we can change/ destroy it  
Constructs change, possibly daily  
Social structures + associated meanings  
Patterns of behavior
 
(All of these are  
Examples of  
Social constructs)

Social Factors:  
Gender  
Race  
Social Class  
Age

The Sport Sociological Perspective:

A perspective to take beyond the course  
Broaden thinking about sport/ society in general  
Teach you how to be critical and analyze sport experiences  
Question what's often taken for granted about sport.

SOCIAL STRUCTURES ENDURE OVER TIME  
Basic elements are abstract and can't be directly observed  
social norms  
statuses  
roles  
relationships  
Networks  
Social norms are on a spectrum of informal to formal  
The most formal can become laws  
The least formal are called folkways  
Statuses are the positions we occupy in society  
defined by their expectations  
Can be context dependent  
Are reciprocal in nature  
Think student â€“ coach  
Social roles are the actions expected of a particular status  
How people interpret and respond to status expectations  
**Role discomfort: when 1 person has 2 roles with conflicting expectations**  
**Role strain: when 1 role is expected to do 2 conflicting things**  
Social Relationships are established when interactions persist over time  
Can be simple or complex
 
Societal Institutions: Enduring patterns that serve larger purposes  
Their existence keeps social order  
Includes family life, religion, economy, etc.

_"Sport is also a societal institution since it is part of the structure of_ _societies. As part of popular culture in modern societies, it serves as a divers__ion or form of entertainment."_

_"Certain kinds of behavior form patterns where the same kinds of things hap-_  
_pen repeatedly to the same kinds of people under the same social or cultural_  
_circumstances or conditions."_

Culture =/ Society
 
Culture: way of life/ beliefs in a society
 
Society: social networks between people in an area

Contact sport athletes aren't masochists because  
Sociological imagination lets us see them as  
"playing into their role"
 
sport sociology focuses our attention on the influence of social forces on team performance, which could minimize the influence of factors such as individual talent.

Capitalist countries believe in individualism  
And the power to shape one's own destiny
 
This leads to bias in personal sports stories

Sport is a subset of society, and faces all the same issues
