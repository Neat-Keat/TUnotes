RACE & SPORT
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Race|A population **Believed** to be naturally/biologically distinct|
|Ethnicity|Cultural heritage -> identify as a category of people|
|Minority Group|Groups of people who suffer disadvantages as a result of systemic discrimination.  <br>(Power is the issue, not size) comparing dominant group to minority group|
 
Race is a social construct

- Research: external traits are not linked with patterns of internal differences
- Racial classification systems vary by culture and over time because they are based on arbitrary distinctions related to physical traits
- Race is based on social definitions and the meanings that people give to physical traits   
   

Think why groups are being influenced to participate or not, NOT a group's "innate" athletic skill
 
Race varies by culture  
A Chinese man in the US is Asian  
A Chinese man in South Africa is Black  
A Japanese man in the US is Asian  
A Japanese man in South Africa is White
 
Racial Ideology in History  
According to racial classification systems, white skin was the standard, and dark skin was associated with intellectual inferiority  
These systems have been used to justify colonization, slavery, and genocide
 
**Ideology:** Beliefs about what ought to be that justify current social arrangements
 
Race, Racial Ideology, & Sport  
Dominant/ Traditional racial ideology encourages people to:

- "See" sport performances in racialized terms
- Use whiteness as the taken-for-granted standard
    
    - Colorblind perspective
        
        - Maintaining the status quo doesnâ€™t let people/groups reflect on racist actions or how people/groups are contributing to systemic racism

Traditional Racial Ideology used in sport  
Racial ideology and stereotypes encourage us to think that the achievements of white athletes are due to:  
Character  
Racial ideology and stereotypes encourage us to think that the achievements of black athletes are due to:  
Biology
 
The beliefs that whites contribute character and blacks contribute biology justifies current social arrangements  
> causes whites to be in thinking/leadership positions  
>causes blacks to be in speed & strength positions  
Racial stacking: under/overrepresentation of races in particular roles  
Racial Ideology in Sport Perpetuates...  
Racial Stacking:  
Race based over/under-representation in certain positions on team sports  
Limited diversity among powerful administrative positions:  
Nearly all top management positions in the major pro men's sports are held by white men
 
The Power of Racial Ideology  
Competition aggravates existing prejudice  
Contact within sport is often superficial  
Racial attitudes are typically resistant to change  
People often make anti-stereotypical information fit into racial ideology
 
Colorblind perspective is bad
