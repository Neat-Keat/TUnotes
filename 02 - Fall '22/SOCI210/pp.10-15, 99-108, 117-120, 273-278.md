The Concept of Sport  
"sport is institutionalized physical competition occurring in formally organized or corporate structures"  
"individuals and groups using their physical skills to try to defeat their opponents in interaction that has winners and losers"  
Sport is Bureaucratic  
Corporate and for profit and all that  
Sport is Institutionalized  
social structure is established and relatively stable
 
PICKUP GAME =/ SPORT  
We must differentiate so we don’t make incorrect assumptions
 
Sport is not necessarily commercial OR professional  
"A number of activities that begin as informally organized recreational physical activities evolve into formally organized sports and ultimately become commercialized and professionalized"  
Snowboarding  
Sport has competitive integrity  
Differentiates MLB from theatrical wrestling  
Sport is secular, not religious  
"I Dedicate this performance to god", but that’s not the purpose
 
Guttmann also proposed that the organization of modern sport emphasizes equality of opportunity, quantification or counting, and records and is bureaucratic, rational, and specialized
 
principle of equality of opportunity  
Sports *should* let everyone compete if they want, but some have barriers to entry, like equipment prices
 
Summarizing Guttmann, the major characteristics of the modern social organization of sport are (1) secularism, (2) bureaucracy, (3) rationality, (4) specialization, (5) quantification, (6) records, and (7) the principle or goal of equality of opportunity
 
Two other characteristics also seem worthy of inclusion in the definition of contemporary sports: the influence of mass media and the influence of economic forces of commercialism and capitalism
 
sport became more associated with the business of making money
 
Not surprisingly, Guttmann (2000:258) observed that modern sports are least popular in the Islamic world, where religious fundamentalism prevails and an aversion to the products of modern scientific rationality and consumer capitalism is strongest—that is, where powerful and pervasive traditional cultural elements contrast sharply with the dominant characteristics of the modern social organization of sport.
      

Bureaucracy is a type of administrative organization based on rational- legal authority in which people are supposed to interact with each other in terms of their competence, their productivity, the rules and goals of the organization, and the positions they hold rather than in terms of their personalities and how much they like each other

Globalization, Mass Media, and Sports Culture
 
How does the Golden Triangle shape/ disseminate sports culture within nations AND thru globalization?  
How does the media play in?  
How does social deviance & problems threaten established cultural & social patters in sport & society?
 
Globalization: The diffusion, spreading, or flow of cultural, social, economic, and political capital, resources, or influences around the world.
 
Global Expansion Theory: capitalism started in industrializing EU, esp. GB, and spread in concentric rings outwards, leaving the poorest nations on the outside.  
Evidenced in the spread of soccer too lol
 
Capitalism has increased global awareness, "shrunk" the world, increased global interactions, and connected local to global influences.
 
Glocalization: reshaping imported sports to fit a new culture  
Glocalization is an important concept because it challenges the assumption rooted in dependency theory that globalization necessarily means that local social patterns and cultural ideas and practices are dominated and replaced by global imports.  
Ritzer (2011) proposed "grobalization", whereby global influences overtook local ideas  
Related to Mcdonaldization  
Americanization is a form of grobalization  
Creates patterns of dependency  
Unlike glocalization, which implies interplay & integration of global & local ideas
 
Globalization and the Golden Triangle  
2nd phase of globalization of sport  
2 cores  
EU soccer  
Because most of the money and players are already EU, top players have to migrate to EU to compete at the top level of their sport  
NA, LATAM, APAC, etc. Are "periphery" regions  
NA "big four"  
NFL  
Tried aggressively to be international, but failed lulw  
NBA  
NHL  
MLB  
US centric; EU, LATAM, APAC, etc. Are "periphery" regions  
Cultural, social, and political forms of capital are more important than economic capital?  
Globalization is likely to be resisted when interpreted as globalization lol  
Like how gender equality is being pushed worldwide lol  
This change happened much slower in the Islamic world (shocker)  
Advocates of change are being helped by the golden triangle in this case  
73% of the Saudi Arabian public unconditionally supports women's participation in sport, although the gov doesn't
 
In some countries w/ major political, social, cultural, etc. Changes, different sports develop their golden triangles differently/ unevenly  
Turkey: Women have professional basketball and volleyball, but not soccer  
Based on TUR's roots as the Ottoman Empire clashing with desire to be like EU  
Golden Triangle will ONLY push for human rights + equality IF it grows sport/ profits  
Economics > Politics + Human Rights
 
Grobalization pressures other nations to grow their sports similarly to the UK and US  
Glocalization breeds innovation thru resistance to "the big guys"  
Big countries glocalize more than grobalize
 
Esp. In Asia, cities are willing to host expensive mega events like the olympics, World Cup, etc., in order to boost visibility and economic stature
 
People supporting their country's exported players are still supporting the Eurocentric/ US-centric golden triangle.  
Think how a Swede supporting NRG Turbo still means supporting NA RL
 
China jumped into capitalist sport aggressively to support its communist ideals.  
As a result it faces greater media scrutiny for things like human rights, pollution, etc.
 
MEDIA INFLUENCE IN GLOBALIZATION AND THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE  
Global media is all-powerful  
It can construct, Transmit, Finance, and Sell sports and turn them into global megaevents  
Enables sports to be as popular as they are, esp. Internationally  
"sports, sports events, and sports celebrities and heroes become commodified as cultural products to be manufactured, marketed, sold, and consumed"  
Newspaper and radio -> Television and Internet  
TV is still the most powerful form  
TV connects local cultures to the global cultural economy  
TV embeds consumer culture of global golden triangle in local cultures  
This also carries commercial messages from corporate sponsors  
Sports media + sponsors are less interested in sports's success, more interested in sports brands that make them money and burnish their own brand  
"Television sports broadcasts emphasize particular cultural values, such as talent, opportunity, achievement, courage, sacrifice, overcoming odds, success, and the American Dream"  
"commercial advertisements do more than expose their audiences to the products their sponsors sell. They also convey the message that we should embrace the cultural practices of consumer capitalism associated with acquisition and accumulation"  
"I should buy Nike because Michael Jordan wears them"  
Buying sports merch lets people identify with something larger than themselves  
Following sport contributes to its legitimacy and profitability  
Does this extend to TV as a whole?
 
"Lipsyte’s (1996) idea of sportainment, which refers to how our sports experiences are mediated by television"
 
WE SEE WHAT TV WANTS US TO SEE  
TV WANTS US TO STAY INTERESTED  
WE'RE GIVEN A FORCED NARRATIVE (and ads lol)
 
Fantasy Sports League participants are more likely to widen the games they watch to include more than just their favorite team

￼The Evolution of the Dominant Sports Culture in the US  
In the US, Sport's importance evolved alongside American culture  
Focuses on Individualism + self-interest in the US
 
Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville ([1853] 1969) observed individualism that he called “egoism”  
Explains why marriages, communities, social capital, etc. fail,  
"Individualism becomes destructive when individuals put themselves above or outside the group, have little commitment to the group, and only care about the group and other people to the extent that they can advance their individual interests"
 
In sport, self-individualism is:  
Ball-hogging, even if tm8 is in better position  
Don’t give tm8s credit  
Not playing support  
Not being a good tm8 can boost ur stats, but lower team stats  
"The American Dream and the American Sports Dream are primarily about the pursuit of self- interest and individual success."  
American athletes playing Japanese baseball, where the team > the individual, have difficulty adjusting to the lack of attention on them
 
Edwards (1973), the central themes of the Dominant American Sports Creed assert that:  
(1) sport builds character by emphasizing such things as clean living, loyalty, and altruism;  
(2) sport teaches discipline by encouraging both self- control and obedience to authority;  
(3) sport encourages competitiveness, which results from courage, perseverance, and aggressiveness and which helps people meet the challenges of life and get ahead in society;  
(4) sport makes people more physically fit;  
(5) sport contributes to mental fitness by making people more mentally sharp and encouraging them to value education;  
(6) sport contributes to religiosity by encouraging acceptance of traditional Christian beliefs; and  
**(7) sport makes people more patriotic**  
This legitimizes sport, but isnt based in systematic research
 
"Indeed, to some extent, the American Dream now may be more about mediated images or the appearance of success than about actual achievement."
 
"Derber (2011) has proposed a darker interpretation of the “New American Dream.” This new version of the American Dream places an excessive emphasis on individualism, reflects a perverted view of morality, and encourages the pursuit of money, power, and fame at all costs"
 
"The New American Dream encourages the belief that one cannot win enough or be successful enough, famous enough, rich enough, or powerful enough."
 
"Wilding occurs when reasonable, moral, legal, and ethical behavior fail to produce the promised success of the American Dream— or American Sports Dream—and individuals turn instead to corrupt, immoral, unethical, illegal, and harmful actions to achieve their elusive success"
 
“Sport Ethic.” Its four major values and norms emphasized  
(1) dedication to “the game” above everything else;  
(2) striving for distinction by constantly striving to be the best, achieve perfection, and win;  
(3) accepting risks and playing with pain; and  
(4) believing that all things are possible and nothing can or will get in the way of success.

POLITICS, ECONOMIES, & SPORT IN A CHANGING WORLD  
Politics: political realms of society where power is exercised by governments or governing bodies  
Includes the actions of citizens/ those outside gov. that influence the gov.  
Includes rules and policies  
Includes enforcement + effects of rules  
Like penalties for doping  
Power: the capacity of people acting individually or collectively to get what they want from others in the face of their perceived or actual resistance.  
Golden Triangles have:  
Economic power  
Cultural power  
Legitimate power is called Authority  
Following someone's power w/o question legitimizes their power into authority  
If people w/ authority can't reasonably make you do something, they turn to interpersonal, group, or organizational power  
Sport officials use their place in pop culture to sway legislation  
If people w/o authority can't reasonably do something, they turn to interpersonal, group, or organizational power  
Women using title IX
 
POWER, POLITICS, & POLITICAL ECONOMY IN SPORT  
Politics and sport understood from various perspectives, like the 4 discussed on day4  
"Sports contests may suggest the possibilities of social and national integration, but they cannot by themselves overcome deep ethnic divisions or enduring political conflicts that governments cannot resolve. They might convey what change could look like but cannot by themselves produce enduring political changes in a country or the world. However, a structural functionalist perspective at least enables us to see that sport may provide brief respites from political turmoil."
 
Symbolic Interactionists explain why people want to change "offensive" team names
 
"Conflict and critical theories emphasize how social and political inequalities in society reinforce each other and how political struggles about issues such as sexism, racism, and exploitation can surface in sport and highlight the inequalities in both sport and society. "
 
"The political economy perspective is critical for understanding how political power and capitalism combine in sport and shape how sports are organized and used by powerful people and organizations "  
Gov. officials using sport to up their popularity and conduct foreign policy
 
Corporate Nationalism  
Exploiting nationalistic/patriotic feelings w/in nations/ localities by associating global brands w/ these feelings
 
"The paradox in these cases is that as the cultural economy of sport in the golden triangle has become more globalized, national and even local identities have become more significant"
 
"Nike’s strategy of corporate nationalism was to use local media outlets to glocalize its advertising message to make it seem relevant to potential consumers in different markets in Asia"
 
"Under Armour’s “protect this house” slogan associated the brand with defending the nation in the post-9/11 period"  
"the message is part- nationalistic, part- militaristic, part- masculine stereotype, and easily tied to sport"

|Politics AND Sport|"mainly refers to how governments exercise power over or through sports in the public domain for their political ends. For example, governments may decide to use public funds to host an Olympics or build a stadium."|
|Politics IN Sport|"concerns how various individuals and organizations outside government and inside and outside sport use power to pursue their own political, economic, or social interests in ways that affect sport. Examples of this perspective include public pressure on sports officials to increase access to sport for women or minorities."|
 
The overlap between the two is found in Corporate Nationalism
