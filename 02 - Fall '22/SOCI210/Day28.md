**COMMERCIAL SPORTS**
 
Goal of Commercial Sports is to:

- Generate Revenue
    
    - Sponsorships
    - Gate Receipts
    - Sale of broadcasting rights
- Provide Entertainment (Sport Sociology focuses on this one!)
    
    - Gain Spectators
        
        - Television
        - Cultural Conditions
            
            - Promote the belief that hard work breeds success in sport
            - Promote the value of sport
    - Uncertain Outcomes ("who's gonna win?")
        
        - Balance talent
        - Conditions for new teams
        - Sport interventions to make it less of a blowout (promotes spectacle, not competition)
    - Changes in sports
        
        - Rules altered
        - Emphasize heroic value
   

You can attract an audience that won't ever play your sport with TV  
Convince audience that a sport is worthy of their time to keep watching  
"X sport promotes Y values, so you should watch it!"  
"this player picked themselves up by their bootstraps!"  
Majority of athletes come from the middle class lol  
Edge cases are celebrated so the audience appreciates it  
"look what this sport is providing for you beyond just entertainment!"  
Commercial Sport extending to youth sport  
Create a new gen of fans and a pipeline of new players
 
"American Audiences want lots of action and lots of scoring, lets change the rules so fans are happy"  
"we'll add gambling and betting to appeal to an audience that doesn't even care about the sport"
 
**SPORT VS SPECTACLE**
 
Sport: athlete-focused  
Spectacle: audience-focused

- Physical Activity – all for display/performance
- Visual event – striking, impressive, and impactful
 
Wrestling lol
   

What is the role of the commentator?  
Connect the audience to the sport?

"What corrupts an athletic performance... is... the presence of an unappreciative, ignorant audience and the need to divert it with sensations extrinsic to the performance. It is at this point that... sports... degenerate into spectacle"

- Christopher Lasch
