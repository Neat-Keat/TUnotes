**YOUTH SPORT**
 
Soci reasons why theres an increased # of kids in youth sport (5)  
Need for day care  
Result of cultural shift  
Social Construct of a "Good Parent"  
Esp middle class and concerted cultivation  
Meaning of a "good parent" changed  
Now it means being involved in their lives and keeping them involved in many things  
Kids are **perceived** as too immature and a danger to themselves  
"they need to be supervised"  
Society is also seen as more dangerous

Year-round commitment  
Is usually problematic bc of injury, burnout (~2/3 of the time)

Can be more fun with more autonomy and control given to kids  
Club pressure to go D1
 
**HIGH SCHOOL SPORT**
 
Differences between HS athletes and non-athletes  
Athletes had positive outcomes like higher GPA, attendance, college attendance, etc.  
Just correlation, NOT causation  
Probably caused by **selection and filtering process**  
Includes factors like money, family support, etc.  
More obvious thru longitudinal studies  
Current research is quantitative, we need qualitative
 
Intersecting factors like gender, race, class
 
**COLLEGE SPORT**
 
Divisions I, II, and III  
Research focuses on D1, compares it to D2 and D3  
Emphasizes Mens Football and Basketball  
Many colleges lose money  
We make assumptions  
Only ~½ of D1 get scholarships  
½ of this gets a full ride  
Academic Detachment  
Athletes drop either grades, social life, or sport  
Most of the time its grades  
D2 and D3 are more likely to have a more similar life to non-athletes  
Bc they are less likely to be separated than D1 athletes in classes, dorms, etc. less likely to be separated than D1 athletes in c  
Also less time and energy commitment  
Graduation Rates among various groups  
Intersections of race and gender
 
Indirect benefits of intercollegiate athletics (3)  
Fundraising for the school  
Gives university power to tweak student body thru more applicants to college  
Corrupt admin?  
Social Events
 
**COMMERCIAL SPORT**
 
How do they provide entertainment?  
"who's gonna win?"
 
Manipulate sport for the audience, not the athlete  
Changing rules and fields to counter super athletes  
Altering rules to create more action, opportunities, and risk for athletes?  
Christopher Lash says we were creating an ignorant audience who doesn't care about the sport  
Too much spectacle added to sports  
7th inning stretch, Halftime performances, fireworks, ads, etc.
