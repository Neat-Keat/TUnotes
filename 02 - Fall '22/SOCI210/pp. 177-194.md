**HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE**
 
Willingness + ability of a school to support athletics depends on:  
Community wealth, value of the athletic program, willingness of taxpayers to pay, willingness of parents to pay fees
 
Most students in the poorest schools do not play school sports  
Some school districts spend huge money to feed sports passion, distance themselves from competitors, and gain community prestige
 
"those who have act differently from those who have-not"  
Privileged HS's have clear evidence of Golden Triangle  
They sign naming rights, attract ad revenue, significantly raise coaches salaries  
HS competition covered locally and by ESPN in 1980s  
Golden triangle likes HS because 3x as many students compared to college, it’s a huge market  
There's also no NCAA equivalent, only state-level interscholastic athletic associations  
National broadcasting + exposure intensifies recruiting pressure on top HS athletes  
A # of HS athletes dropping out to play exclusively for travel teams  
Better road to collegiate scholarships?  
Byproduct of commercialization and golden triangle  
"Among the issues identified in this study were the influence of shoe manufacturers, ambitious and self- serving coaches, questionable recruiting practices, steroids and other performance- enhancing drugs, lavish gifts to athletes, and increasing specialization encouraged by club sports"  
"focus on academics pls"
 
**JUSTIFICATIONS AND BENEFITS OF HS AND YOUTH SPORTS**
 
HS seen as a way to assimilate immigrants  
"their assumption was that socialization into school sports would lead to productive socialization through sports, making former athletes better adjusted and more successful as adults. "  
Suggested that HS sports cause higher grades, better academic self-concept, fewer disciplinary problems, better attendance, less dropping out, better standardized test scores, better college prep, better grad rates, higher college attendance and grad rates  
However, if you identify as a jock, you may not do as well academically, etc.  
HS sports tend to improve health, enhance body esteem, maintain a healthy weight, increase popularity, increase life satisfaction, and educational achievement.  
The extent is determined by grade, income, and location
 
View HS sports as an institutional resource and form of social capital  
Connections, group norms and importance, enhanced status, etc.
 
**THE ULTIMATE JUSTIFICATION: KEEPING KIDS OUT OF TROUBLE**
 
Roche says that sports cause violence bc they enhance running, channeling impulsive behavior, and using force. They also provide young men with their first opportunity to fight.  
Not persuasive
 
In general: more time devoted to sports = more likely they were to have committed a serious crime  
Especially of working-class boys
 
Only positive impact on delinquency among 13-14 white-collar boys
 
Acensi agrees positive claims are overblown, but disappointing claims tied to poor management, not the sport
 
Lamour disagrees, thinks sports do wonders and instill norms into children
 
Hirschi (1969) says that social bonds keep people out of trouble  
"I don’t want to let them down"
 
Kelley + Sokol-Katz (2011) statistical analysis of longitudinal study  
3 hypotheses

1. Sports leave less time for delinquency (CONTRADICTED)
2. More involvement in = more delinquency than less involvement (SUPPORTED)
3. Athletes in more cohesive families w/ supportive friends = less delinquency (SUPPORTED)
 
Found that only regularly smoking cigarettes was curtailed by sports
 
Not affected by contact vs noncontact
 
Over 20k active US street gangs  
"the choice often faced by teenage boys and even some girls in gang- infested neighborhoods is to join a gang or try to leave the neighborhood"
 
"Athletes sometimes found themselves in the middle of gang competition to recruit them, since they could add visibility and prestige to a gang’s reputation"  
"Thus, some star athletes might experience pressure from both gang recruiters and college recruiters at the same time. However, being known on the streets as a member of a particular gang could make these athletes targets of rival gangs. "
 
**ISSUES AND PROBLEMS OF YOUTH AND HS SPORTS**
 
Sports do NOT protect teens from trouble / serious life problems  
ALL athletes at risk, not just minorities, males, the poor, etc.
 
"when youths get excessively caught up in the cultural incentives and pressures of sports in the golden triangle, the positive aspects and effects of sports participation may be diminished or reversed."
 
Positive rhetoric about sports is exaggerated, misleading, mistaken
 
"The Eitles found that relatively higher rates of male participation in football and basketball were associated with being more culturally disadvantaged and being less involved in courses and activities that increased cultural capital. "
 
Poor males more interested in status gains from school sports than to enhance cultural capital
 
Too much commitment to sports is costly for poor and minority students
 
Still a gender gap lol  
￼"US public schools typically spend more tax dollars on average per athlete than they spend per student in math"
 
"schools with higher rates of athletic participation for both sexes and across racial and ethnic groups had lower rates of student suspensions, less violence and assault, and higher scores on math, foreign language, and science Advanced Placement (AP) exams"
 
Parents encourage sport participation, but are scared of injuries
 
1.35 mil youth per year go to ER bc of sports  
Once every 25 seconds!
 
Serious HS athletes 70% more vulnerable to overuse injuries
 
"It appears that the more competitive and demanding youth sports become in school or corporate programs, the more they put kids at risk—of emotional distress, burnout, and serious injury"
 
"The problem is that once schools take sports seriously, it may be difficult to scale down their ambitions and put athletics in a proper perspective in relation to academics in the school."
 
"top high school sports programs in boys basketball participate in nationally televised games; receive fees plus expense money to play in these games; and generate equipment contracts for themselves, broadcast rights fees for ESPN and regional sports networks, and investment from corporate sponsors. In addition, print publications such as High School Basketball Illustrated (HSBI) have annual subscription rates of $400, and online recruiting services such as Hoop Scout.com can cost $500 per year or more."
 
Sneaker wars:  
Fighting over youth athletes to wear your brand
 
"Some of the coaches and promoters involved with elite teams have acknowledged paying young basketball players for expenses that were not related to their sport, which could later jeopardize their NCAA eligibility."
 
"Only the most disciplined are able to manage their priorities and also be serious students."
 
One family spent 30k on a kid over 6 years lulw
 
"social class is likely to be a significant filter in access to participation in certain high school sports as well as elite youth sports in general."
 
"Even though it was a violation of NCAA rules, US colleges paid Nigerian coaches about $5,000 for each talented player they identified and delivered. "
 
"A number of these players first play for US high schools as a stepping- stone to playing in college, and they hope at least to be able to return home with a college degree if their professional basketball dream does not become a reality."
 
"For all but a relatively few athletes, serious sports involvement ends in adolescence."
 
'they may have to deal with the lingering effects of having sacrificed their bodies to pursue their big- time sports dream."

"youth sports could be seen as a “catalyst” or mediator of positive educational outcomes. This meant that participation in sports was not by itself a direct cause or effect of positive educational and psychosocial outcomes. However, it was associated with these benefits when it was interwoven with an assortment of other factors that shaped the socialization of young sports participants. These other factors included the influences of family, school, community, peer group, coaches, teachers, and cultural beliefs."

"In general, though, in a population of one hundred boys and young men between thirteen and nineteen years old who participated in sports seven to eight hours a week, 24.5 percent, on average, said they had committed at least one serious crime. “Serious crimes” included car theft, burglary, racketeering, drug or other criminal traffic, stone throwing, or violence resulting in medical intervention."

"athletes were significantly more likely than nonathletes to do graffiti, run away from home, steal more than $50, steal a car, damage property, engage in fighting, physically hurt someone, and participate in group violence."

"Even though playing one sport was not a significant predictor of delinquency, playing two or more sports was a strong predictor. It appears that those more heavily involved in sports and more drawn to risk taking tended to commit more serious delinquent acts. "

"Additional analysis showed that males had higher levels of more serious delinquency and whites tended to be less involved in more serious delinquency. It was also found that those from more affluent families had lower levels of general delinquency. Risk taking was also broadly linked with delinquency."

"to be able to benefit from their high school experience, high school students from less advantaged backgrounds need to keep their eyes focused on activities that give them an opportunity to develop cultural capital. Athletics may not be one of these activities"

"Unlike their generally more affluent classmates who played sports and were involved in activities that built their cultural and social capital, the more disadvantaged football and basketball players gained very little academically or educationally from their concentration on sports. To the extent that students from less advantaged backgrounds trade opportunities to accumulate cultural capital for their concentration on certain sports, they may pay the price of not building the kind of educational motivation and background needed for better academic achievement."

"the most common sports injuries for children and youths in the six to nineteen age group were sprains and strains, fractures, contusions, abrasions, and concussions. The most frequent injuries involved the ankle (15 percent), the head (14 percent), finger (10 percent), knee (9 percent), and face (7 percent)."

![Probe 6.5: Sports Can Be a Greater TBI Risk for Girls than Boys The data about gender differences in concussion rates may be surprising in light of common gender stereotypes about physical aggression and risk. Research has sug- gested that in sports with similar rules and comparable physical demands, such as soccer, basketball, and baseball/softball, females seem to have a greater risk of con- cussions and may experience more severe concussions (e.g., see Healy 2013; Kerasidis 2014). Furthermore, after suffering a concussion, recovery time may be longer for boys than girls, but girls are likely to experience more symptoms, more loss of memory, and slower reaction times. Adolescent symptoms can include headaches and worsened attention deficit disorders, depression, and anxiety (Farnan-Kennedy 2011). Girls may be more vulnerable to TBIs for anatomical reasons, such as less developed neck muscles and smaller head-size-to-body ratios than boys. There also may be cultural reasons (de Lench 2014). For example, parents may have more protective attitudes toward girls and be more sensitive to possible injuries to them, resulting in more medi- cal attention and thus more reported injuries. Boys also may be more likely to under- report their injuries because hypermasculine sports cultures may discourage their acknowledgment of pain and injumy. Whatever the rates and reasons for concussions in youth sports, it seems important for the people who run these programs to recognize the risk to both sexes and to structure their sports to tly to minimize the risk. This is not so easy, though, when sports almost inevitably involve impacts to the head. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202831-0.png) ![Probe 6.6: Becoming a Sports Prospect and Commodity at a Young Age One of the socialization lessons for talented young athletes and their families is that boys and girls with athletic talent in certain sports, such as Lucy Li in golf, are valuable commodities for corporate sponsors, appealing subjects for the mass media, a source of revenue for sports academies and camps, and a vehicle for professional coaches and trainers and elite sports programs to enhance their status and careers. Even talented athletes in elementaly school may draw the interest of the golden triangle, as the case of a ten-year-old basketball prospect in the Baltimore area showed (Saslow 2006a). Such players could look forward to being ranked by college recruiting websites as fifth graders. Thus, the social world of this boy involved the possibility of national attention in elementary school, special coaches to hone his skills, and overtures from a number of AAU coaches and local private school recruiters. The young prospect's father wanted him to be "comfortable and carefree" and "a little kid at home," but he also told his son he had to be serious, "an impact player" on the court, and not waste his big chance at sports success. His mother was acutely aware that her son was only ten years old and that many people wanted to "buy" him. She wanted people to know that her son was "not for sale," but the world of youth sports constructed by the golden triangle transforms talented athletes of any age into commodities. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202831-1.png)
