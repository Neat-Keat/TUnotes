**PROFESSIONAL SPORTS**
 
Little question of golden triangle in pro sport
 
"Conflicts over money, collective bargaining, strikes, and lockouts are not what fans want to see in professional sports, but they have become part of the game in these sports."
 
Fans know sports are corrupt, but come back because they love the sport so much  
(doping, match fixing, targeted violence, etc)
 
Sometimes a scandal can serious hurt a sport's reputation tho  
Lance Armstrong and cycling lulw
 
US public AND investors love different sports to different degrees  
At the top are the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL  
NASCAR just outside apparently lol
 
Other countries have sports like cricket, rugby, auto racing, cycling, tennis, and golf  
But Soccer's always at the top lol
 
**THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE AND THE PRO SPORTS INDUSTRY**
 
US pro sports is capitalistic with antitrust behavior
 
"Pro sports are successful when they are able to produce entertaining sports products in collaboration with their media and business partners in their golden triangle"
 
Over time, pro sports become increasingly dependent on media exposure and money  
Tilts the golden triangle's balance to media  
True of college athletics too!
 
Influence of golden triangle evident in price of broadcasting rights
 
"television rights contracts in England and Germany had increased the broadcast revenues of the top five soccer leagues in Europe by 25 percent, amounting to $6.7 billion per season"
 
MLS had cheap TV deals and poor viewership  
90% of revenue came from places other than TV
 
NASCAR > MLS in the US
 
"these rising cost factors are making it more difficult for many [soccer] teams to make a profit in their sport"
 
"fans have come to believe that watching their favorite team on television is their right."
 
1/3 of big 4 NA sports teams owners have a background in media and entertainment businesses
 
"Although specific motivations and interests may vary across different sectors of the golden triangle, shared incentives and interests are the money, status, and power that can be made from their partnerships. These partnerships enable golden triangles in the pro sports industry to impose their interests on the sports public, employees of sports businesses, and competing firms outside the boundaries of these networks of power."
   

**SPORTS MONOPOLIES, FANS, AND THE PUBLIC**
 
ALL enterprises in the golden triangle NEED fans and consumers to be profitable  
Does NOT mean the welfare of fans is a priority  
Sports often act in ways that exploit/ignore fan interests
 
Some soccer teams are fan owned, like Real Madrid, with 93,000 member owners, or FC Barcelona, with 222,000 owners
 
Fan owned models like Spain's La Liga or Germany's Bundeslinga are great!

- Lower cost of season tickets
- Bidding wars arent exaggerated
- Fosters domestic talent
    
    - Easier fan identification with players   
   

"Socio systems in soccer are like other types of democratic organizations. They give a voice to the rank and file but are not managed on a day- to-day basis by the rank and file. However, giving the fans a voice in these clubs means that they have a chance to play a role in hiring, budgeting, commercial deals, and other key decisions that affect the operation of their club. Fans can push for quality on the field, wider access to the stadium through cheaper ticket prices, and sensible and thrifty budget management"
 
ONLY big 4 NA team with a similar model is the Green Bay Packers lol
 
Ticket prices in NA steadily rising  
Even past the reach of an average income
 
Both fans AND non-fans are paying for sports on tv they may or may not watch
 
"Television is the major conduit of money flowing through the golden triangle "
 
ESPN = cash cow
 
Paying extra for premium TV packages = sports tax  
Means that even if you only watch NCAA, ESPN is profiting bc its bundled in
 
"Unbundling ESPN and other sports channels from the basic monthly package would cost their subscribers more money for these premium services, but would lower the cable and satellite bills for the subscribers who did not choose them. This unbundling could be the pin that bursts the sports cable balloon and seriously disrupts the fundamental business model of professional sports and other commercial sports in the golden triangle."
 
"business model of North American professional sports is not fan- friendly and may be costly to the general public as well in North America. "
 
Public subsidies for stadiums are almost exclusively an NA thing
 
"in the United States, taxpayers were paying billions of dollars to finance the construction and maintenance of stadiums for privately owned professional sports teams"
 
NA teams can threaten to relocate franchises successfully, unlike EU
 
"professional sports leagues turn public subsidies into private profits"
 
"Only three NFL teams—the New England Patriots, New York Giants, and New York Jets—paid three- quarters or more of their stadium’s capital costs"
 
"Overall, in the average public/private partnership for these stadiums and arenas, cities assumed 78 percent of the full cost, including known and hidden costs, and teams assumed 22 percent"
 
"as sports facilities grew in size, they became increasingly rationalized or McDonaldized, risking their appeal to fans."
 
Baseball stadiums evolved to be cold and nondescript  
Cause of attendance drop in 60s-80s?  
Postmodern ballparks, beginning w/ Orioles Park @ Camden Yards in 1992 made it worse  
Turned ballpark into a "virtual shopping mall"
