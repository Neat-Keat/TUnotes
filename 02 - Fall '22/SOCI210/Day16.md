Research on boyhood experiences in Sport  
Gender identity: process of construction while interacting w/ the social world
 
Interviews w/ adult males  
Only "natural"  
Because of social expectations, not "natural"  
Expected: therefore *social* reasoning
 
Research on Boyhood Experiences in Sport  
Male World  
Early Sport Experiences:

- Need to connect w/ others
- NOT interested in competition/ independence

Later Sport Experiences

- Work on becoming more skillful
- Success matters

Boys become hyper-competitive because they DIDNT get their connection to others  
"If I win, my family will love me"
 
These male athletes learned that by being competitively successful in sport, they get what they want  
Desire: acceptance and connections
 
Research on Recreational Male Athletes  
Defining / Developing the Masculine Body

- Fear, Anxiety, Pressure

Use critical theory to see that gender impacts males as well as females

INTERSECTIONALITY  
Social Factors Intersecting  
A cross of 2+ factors can result in specific types of experiences and patterns  
Gender/ Race/ Social Class/ Ability/ Age
 
WOMEN with disabilities are disadvantaged in a culture where femininity and heterosexual attractiveness are equated  
ï¿¼MEN with disabilities are disadvantaged in a culture where manhood is constructed through narratives of conquest and domination

Q: Pain or Injury?  
Pain: can keep playing  
Injury: pulled from the game
 
"men should be able to tolerate pain"  
Leads to an expectation of disrespect for the body  
Athletes DEPERSONALIZE their pain/injuries  
In an effort to separate themselves from their injured body  
"my body" -> "the body"
