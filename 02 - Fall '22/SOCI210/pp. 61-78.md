DIVERSITY AND INEQUALITIES IN SPORT
 
"sports have erected structural barriers of discrimination that have restricted access, mobility, and rewards for people of lower- status backgrounds"
 
"also created hurdles of prejudice that have made success in sport more difficult to attain or enjoy for those from lower- class and minority backgrounds and females who have broken through the barriers of discrimination"
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Prejudice|Inflexible & irrational generalization about a category of people|
|Discrimination|Unequal treatment of a category of people|
|Minority Group|Category of people perceived as physically or culturally different and inferior|
 
Golden Triangle expands opportunity and drops barriers  
Discrimination and prejudice are less, but still present
 
DEALING WITH DIFFERENCE IN SPORT
 
Cultural pluralism is popular in schools  
Controversial bc respecting too many differences can fragment a society  
Alternative is a melting pot
 
Sports authorities use the progressive character of modern sports to construct a narrative that sports teams bring together people from various backgrounds in the common goal of winning  
Validates the American Sports Dream  
Enables the Golden Triangle  
Positive feedback loop
 
"Although prejudice and discrimination have generally lessened in intensity, remnants of the past continue to influence how women and minorities are treated in the golden triangle."
 
GENDER AND SPORT  
￼Sexism is the historically dominant gender ideology in the US and the world  
"males are naturally superior to females due to their greater physical prowess and that, as a result, males deserve more respect, authority, and privilege than females."  
Justifies the Patriarchy  
Institutional sexism is when sexist things are so normalized/naturalized that they're to be expected and accepted
 
People assume differences in gender identities, statuses, and roles traditionally associated with sex differences are natural.  
Sex differences /= gender differences
 
"They have conveyed a broad justification for male privilege in relations with women and encouraged men to think of women as sexual objects rather than in terms of what women are capable of doing with their bodies and minds."
 
Sexism dates back to ancient times  
Greece had the Heraean Games for women, where they were expected to be "fertile and feminine", while men had the Olympics
 
Sport was a "male preserve" in the US right up till title IX  
Men participate to establish masculinity  
Women watch to ensure femininity  
"0 percent women in 1896 to over 44 percent in the 2012 London Summer Games and over 40 percent in the 2014 Sochi Winter Games"  
50% in 2014 for the first time
 
Title IX was a thing that happened lol  
>332,000 female athletes turned to 1.3mil in 2 years (1974)  
2012 saw 3mil, or 1 in 2 high school females, and 200k at the collegiate level
 
Women in sports are healthier, more successful, and more competitive in the work force
 
Gender gap is stabilizing/ widening in the US  
"high school girls increased their participation in athletics between 1993 and 2000 and achieved greater gender equity during this period, reducing the gender gap from 14 percent to 11 percent. However, this trend essentially came to a halt between 1999 and 2006, and then the gender gap increased to 13 percent by 2010"
 
Boys have 1-2 more teams than girls @ school on average  
Male athletes are the least likely to support more teams for girls  
This reinforces the golden triangle and institutional sexism  
2000-2010 "era of lost opportunity"  
Gender gap widened instead of shrank  
"illusion of equality" made parents lazy and stop advocating  
"The percentage of schools without interscholastic athletic programs rose from 8.2 percent in 2000 to 15 percent ten years later. Athletic programs were more likely to be dropped in urban schools (9.6 percent) than in schools in rural (7.7 percent), town (6.6 percent), or suburban (5.8 percent) areas"  
￼"African American females typically attended high schools that did not offer many of the sports that provided pathways to college athletic scholarships, for example, soccer, volleyball, crew, and softball. As a result, African American females tended to be highly concentrated in a few college sports, in particular, bowling, basketball, and track"
 
Gender gap shrunk, but racial gap for minority females got much worse
 
AIAW was formed after Title IX to let women compete  
NCAA felt threatened in 1980 and started offering women's championships  
AIAW was out of business by 1982  
Means that women no longer run women's sports (90% of female coaches to 38%)  
"84.5 percent of coaches in Division I were white males and 92 percent in Division III were white males"  
"at the Division I level 30 percent of associate athletic directors were women. Male and female African Americans held less than 10 percent of athletic director and associate athletic director positions at any NCAA level. One of the most powerful positions in the sport sector of the golden triangle is commissioner of an FBS conference. In 2012, 100 percent of these eleven positions were held by white men"
 
Dominance of men in women's sports reflects institutional sexism
 
Gender Neutrality: paradoxical practice of recognizing the need to change the skewed gender ratio in leadership but failing to acknowledge that gender or sexism had anything to do with it.  
Contributes to institutional sexism  
"The women in these positions felt pressure to exhibit gender neutrality in order to be taken seriously in the male- dominated sports world."
 
As long as sport is a male preserve, women will likely be viewed as strange and unfeminine, and have to deal with sexist stereotypes
 
Olympics added women's volleyball in 1964, basketball in 76, and field hockey in 1980  
Women's ice hockey prevents intentional checking, unlike men's  
Most successful teams play a more aggressive "manly style"
 
"For serious women athletes, though, the point is to have equivalent kinds of opportunities to play and equal rewards for the same kinds of success"
 
"They also want a chance to show that they have the ability to take their place on the sidelines and in the front office."
 
Sports are not only gendered, but also play a gendering role in socialization
 
Females in manly sports are seen as lesbian  
Males in feminine sports are seen as gay  
Leads to homophobia and issues with gender expression
 
SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND SPORT  
Golden triangle is reactive, not proactive, to social change  
Means heterosexual males are scared to figure skate, etc.  
"The stigmatization of gay males and lesbians often deprives them of the freedom of open gender expression, full enjoyment of their sports, and the respect and other rewards their talents and accomplishments deserve."
 
Locker rooms are still homophobic, who knew?  
Athletes use slurs, crazy  
People are scared to come out , what :interrobang:
 
Homophobia in college athletics is declining  
Representative of college as a whole
 
The Golden Triangle isn't intentionally aiding those who are against human rights etc., it just doesn't want the bottom line to be affected  
Change comes from outside the golden triangle
 
Gay athletes tend to play individual sports where there's less homophobia and its easier to protect an identity
   

"sex testing reflects concerns that women who are too manly or are too much like men have  
an unfair advantage in competition"  
Resurrects arguments that women can't compete with men fairly
 
Sexism limits opportunities of women  
Homophobia limits opportunities of the LGBT community
 
"Welts’s success in finding a new high-level job in his sport indicated that in his workplace, homophobia was muted by his demonstrated competence."  
(As it should)
 
"At this point, relatively more progress has been made in struggles to reduce inequalities of social class, gender, race, and ethnicity than in efforts to reduce inequalities of sexual orientation and disability in sport because society in general has lagged in the latter types of efforts"

American Sports Dream is true for all american demographics, not just straight white upperclass men

![Probe 3.3: Invisibility of women's Sports in the Media Part of gender normalcy in US sports is the limited visibility of women's sports in media coverage. Certain sports are almost totally invisible. Research has pointed to women's baseball as an example of this invisibility (Ring 2013). Even though the US Wt)men's National Team earned a medal in a highly competitive Women's World Cup in Venezuela in 2010. this success v.'as largely unreported by the US media and largely unknown to the US public. The irony is that Team USA received an enthusiastic svel• come in Caracas and played in packed stadiums and drew large television audiences. Their lack of attention and financial support at home may have reflected the popular cultural belief that men play baseball and women play softball in the United States. This kind of thinking is what institutional sexism means. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202818-0.png)

"Poorer boys and young men have fewer options for defining themselves as successful, which is especially important to males in a culture where males are supposed to be dominant and successful. Thus, the importance of success in sport is inversely related to a male’s social class: the lower the class, the more important is sports success."

Should homosexuality be accepted? (2013)

|US|60%|
|Spain|88%|
|Germany|87%|
|Canada|80%|
|Czech Republic|80%|

"A moral compass has not guided the golden triangle in its approach to  
sexual orientation. It has been guided more by its interest in keeping in tune  
with the changing attitudes of its fan and consumer base."

![Probe 3.6: Social Pressures and the Problem of Being Openly Homosexual in Sport Lesbian basketball star Brittney Griner publicly announced her sexual orientation in 2013. but she waited until after she had completed her career at Baylor University. She explained that this was because her coaches '.vere uncomfortable with her being open about her sexual orientation. She was even asked to remove a tweet revealing her homosexuality. Her coaches mred that such openness could imply that they accepted homosexuality and that this could cost them potential recruits (Morgan 2013). kind of pressure from club officials and agents also explains why gay male players have been reluctant to come out in association football (soccer) in Europe. In their study of these athletes. Cashmore and Cleland (2011 ) observed that this pressure was the main reason for a "culture of secrecy" regarding sexual orientation that allowed or encour - aged homophobia in the sport. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202818-1.png)
