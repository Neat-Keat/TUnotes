STRATIFICATION, SOCIAL CLASS, AND SOCIAL MOBILITY IN SPORT
 
Society & sport: things are not equal  
Social stratification: persisting patterns of unequal or hierarchical distributions of valued things to different groups of people  
More stratified societies have more distance between steps of the stratification ladder.
 
SOCIAL CLASS AND MOBILITY
 
Social class: category of people w/ the same relative economic status  
Their existence implies class inequality
 
Managers have more control than ever before.  
Jobs shifted from industrial-based to service based.  
Financial sector more prominent  
Athletes can be considered entertainment workers
 
Stratified systems can have social mobility, but each class remains relatively the same size and position.
 
Structural mobility: an entire category of people move up or down the social ladder
 
The US has an _open stratification system_ because individuals can move up or down as a result of personal achievements.
 
Closed systems are ones based on slavery, estates, castes, etc., where mobility is near-impossible
 
Mobility can rise and fall, like a roller coaster!
 
"Structures of inequality can be weakened or changed by intentional or unintentional efforts to transform the stratification system"  
Marxism lol
 
Max Weber: "social and political dimensions of stratification are also seen as consequential factors affecting structure and change in societies"  
Broader conception of class inequalities than Marxism  
-class is related to relative amount of marketable skills, qualifications, and property, along with material wealth  
Weber focused on social inequalities of prestige, deference, social worth, or social honor  
Weber focused on political inequalities of access to authority and the opportunities or resources for exercising power.  
These views led to the study of socioeconomic status (SES)  
-composite ranking of standing in society based on dimensions of social inequality.  
Like education, income, job prestige, and residential situation!
 
Past patterns of inequality persist over time
 
SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND SPORT
 
NCAA is the historically dominant org in college athletics  
3 divisions  
Div 1:  
"big time", football has Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) > Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) schools at the top of D1 are "the majors", and low D1 is "mid-majors"  
Div 2:  
Div 3:
 
"Since the National Football League (NFL) has had a strong commitment to revenue sharing and competitive parity, it should not be surprising that it has had a smaller wealth gap than those of sports leagues such as the National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and European soccer, which have been less committed to revenue sharing and parity"
 
Coaching roles are stratified, with some receiving over $1 mil salaries  
NCAA div 1 & 2 athletes can have educational grants, but usually arent compensated since they're "amateurs".
 
Winnings based sports have larger ranges of pay than salary based sports
 
EXPLAINING SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN SPORT
 
"Structural functionalism emphasizes the motivational value of unequal economic and social rewards in the productive process."  
-this ignores the dysfunctional consequences of excessive inequality lulw
 
"structures become institutionalized because society needs them, and evidence that society needs them is the fact that they are institutionalized in the social structure."  
-structural-functionalism is a bit circular, no?
 
Marxist conflict explains wage gaps as reflections of domination and exploitation of sports workers by owners and management  
"athletes and coaches have big salaries bc it lets managers have even bigger salaries, even if it causes athletes to be stressed or coaches to lose family time."
 
"Economic and social inequalities can motivate performance in open stratification systems, but excessive and enduring gaps between classes can cause envy and anger and provoke powerful reactions and conflicts. Job insecurity could be an important motivator, but lavish and secure long- term contracts could make athletes complacent. Furthermore, too much job insecurity could make athletes too nervous to be able to compete effectively, and paychecks perceived as too small could make them too frustrated to care about playing better. Thus, we must be careful not to make sweeping generalizations about the implications of social stratification for sports or the people who participate in them."
 
SOCIAL CLASS AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF SPORT
 
"it is widely believed that sport is a meritocracy in which talent and hard work trump social background in the attainment of status."
 
SES is becoming less relevant in participation
 
"Research has shown that when compared with nonathletes eight years after they were slated to graduate from high school, former high school athletes were more likely to have gone to college and graduated, to have a full- time job, and to make more money"
 
"Graduating from high school and especially graduating from college are important because educational attainment is a significant predictor of social status and the chances of mobility (Supiano 2014). "
 
Sport keeps kids in school and makes them more likely to attend college  
Sport increases peoples socioeconomic status for this reason
   

"a society in which the difference in average annual incomes between the richest 10 percent and the poorest 10 percent is $150,000 is more stratified than one in which this gap is $75,000."

"The basis of class distinction in modern capitalist societies is between those who own or control the means of production such as factories, equipment, and financial resources and those who work for these owners and do not share in the ownership or control of the productive process or the goods they produce through their labor"

"individuals’ chances of success may be affected more by forces of society over which they have little personal control than by their own efforts."

"The higher levels have more athletic talent, financial support for programs, financial and academic support for athletes, commercialization, visibility, and economic and political power in the NCAA. They also generally have bigger and more expensive facilities, and pay coaches and administrators higher salaries."

D1 colleges can spend anywhere from 134 mil to < 5 mil
 
"past success produces the resources needed for future success. Institutions with fewer resources have more difficulty moving up the college sports hierarchy and staying there."

"Professional athletes and coaches in the most commercialized college sports generally make significantly more than the median family income in the United States of slightly more than $51,000 in 2012 (Lowrey 2013). But they make much less than the stars in their sports."

![Probe 2.1: Sport Needs Losers A logical extension of the structural-functional perspective could be that sport needs losers, minor leaguers, and bench warmers. "Ihey are needed because they reinforce a belief in the importance of sacrificing and winning by showing the adverse conse- quences to reputation and economic status and the influence of not trying hard enough to win. This view of the functions of having a "lower class" of losers and also-rans in sport is similar to Gans's analysis of the functions of the "undeserving poor" for US society, particularly those who are more advantaged. In his creative use of the function- alist perspective, Gans ( 1972) suggested that more advantaged people want and need us to believe that poor people deserve their poverty. "Ihey hold an enduring stereotype of poor people as undeserving of help and a better life because, among other things, they are perceived as irresponsible and lazy. This kind of stereotype of the undeserving poor allows advantaged members of society to blame the poor as scapegoats for the ills of society, stigmatize them as perpetual losers, and ignore or dismiss them. This stereotype also reinforces the idea that not being serious about the pursuit of the American Dream can have very negative consequences, and it obscures the facts that many disadvantaged people actually share the same aspirations and work just as hard as those who are more advantaged. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202825-0.png)

Probe 2.2: Paying to Play High School Sports
 
In one public school district in Ohio, for example, fees varied by sport, costing $521 for cross country, $715 for golf, $783 for football, and $933 for tennis (Cook 2012). In Utah, district- imposed fees to play high school football may be much more modest than in this Ohio school district, but the cost of playing this sport in Utah may be inflated by optional fees determined by coaches (Donaldson 2013). These optional fees ranged from zero to over $800, and some schools that claimed to have no additional fees expected athletes and families to participate in fund- raisers to cover the cost of summer camps, weekly team meals, weight training in the summer, highlight videos, and “spirit clothes” such as T-shirts and shorts. Although there were efforts to help finance students whose families struggled financially and legal restrictions on making optional fees mandatory, a number of these financially struggling families perceived the costs to be an obligation and did not let their children try out. In general, it appears that unless aspiring young athletes are fortunate enough to be from affluent families that can afford the fees, are good enough to be subsidized or sponsored, or live in communities that offset fees with sponsorships from generous local businesses, playing school sports may not be affordable. Less advantaged youths who want to compete in club sports outside the school generally find the costs of registration, coaches, equipment and clothing, tournaments, and travel quite expensive. Only those talented enough to be sponsored are likely to participate.
