AS A COLLECTIVE GROUP (Not necessarily individually), AMERICANS VALUE:  
1) Achievement and success ***  
2) Individualism ***  
3) Activity and work  
4) Efficiency and Practicality  
5) Science and technology  
6) Progress  
7) Material comfort  
8) Humanitarianism  
9) Freedom  
10) Democracy  
11) Equality  
12) Racism and group superiority
 
Lots of overlap, like in 5+6  
Material Comfort does NOT necessarily man having stuff  
Its more about upper class, high status thinking  
(think rolex instead of nikes)
