"the intercollegiate golden triangle plays a prominent role in this world"  
NCAA and officials romanticize it for an outside audience
 
Athletics = 1st significantly commercialized part of US higher ed  
Began with an 8-oared barge (crew race) between Harvard and Yale
 
Ivy Leagues were "pivotal in the growth, popularization, and commercialization of college athletics in the United States"  
Harvard had a sports day declared: "Bloody Monday"
 
Early college athletics were controlled by students, and schools did not officially sanction/authorize them (similar to a club model)  
Evolved over 2nd half of 19th century, slowly and steadily into bureaucratically organized and ran by college admin and alumni.  
Lead to faculty athletic committees
 
Students had completely lost control over athletics by early 1900s  
"Athletics came to be seen as a vehicle to serve institutional ends"  
Modern day structure in place by 1920s
 
**THE POPULAR AND PECULIAR INSTITUTION OF BIG-TIME COLLEGE SPORTS IN THE US**
 
As college sport popularized in the 19th century, colleges standardized everything  
Competition, academic eligibility, etc.
 
1876: Intercollegiate Football Association by Harvard, Yale, and Princeton
 
Still issues w/ academic integrity, professionalism, institutional control, injuries, and death
 
1905: calls to abolish sport  
Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the US (IAAUS) formed to address concerns  
Became NCAA in 1910
 
College sport justified as a means to: "market the institution to prospective students, increase student morale and institutional loyalty, build alumni support, enhance the institution’s visibility and reputation, and make money"  
Found to usually be "overstated or untrue"
 
March Madness, a single game can generate 1.15 BILLION in ad revenue
 
Declining concern about college athletics being "out of control"  
83% have a positive view on college sport
 
"The success of universities and the intercollegiate golden triangle in selling the institutional enhancement rationale is an important reason why big- time college sports remain popular"
 
Carnegie Foundation investigations in 1926, papers in 29 and 31
 
Big time college sport is a uniquely US phenomenon  
Characterized by extensive recruitment, athletic scholarships, implied promises of professional/olympic opportunities
 
**STRATIFICATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS IN COLLEGE SPORTS TODAY**
 
Athletic trap (created and reinforced by golden triangle)  
"defined as a complex array of social, economic, and political commitments that severely constrains athletic decisions by university leaders. "  
"difficult to escape because financial obligations, relationships, and expectations regarding big- time sports are firmly in place"  
Results in stratification in college sports  
Big gaps between "haves" and "have-nots"
 
Title IX does NOT stop unfair funding lol
 
Stratification in NCAA and among conferences  
NCAA has 460,000 student-athletes  
NAIA has 60,000 student-athletes
 
NCAA is internally stratified with Div I, II, and III
 
"Division I member schools have to compete in at least seven sports for men and seven for women, or six for men and eight for women. At least two of the men’s sports and two of the women’s sports must be team sports. Division I schools with football are classified as either Football Bowl College Athletics  205 Subdivision (FBS) (formerly Division I-A) or Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) (formerly Division I-AA). All Division I members must meet minimum financial aid award standards and cannot exceed a stipulated maximum award level. However, football programs in the FBS must meet a minimum attendance requirement (15,000 average). They also tend to spend much more on their football programs than do schools at the FCS and lower NCAA levels, and they generate much more revenue"
 
BCS bowls were the most prestigious, widely publicized, and lucrative football games
 
Div I has a stratification of conferences  
Schools compete to be in the most lucrative  
Called churning  
Usually results in top teams moving up and bottom teams moving down
 
NCAA controls televised Basketball, but not football
 
"Big-time college sports had achieved some stability at the highest level in the early years of the BCS with six elite conferences: the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and Southeastern Conference (SEC)."
 
Major driver of changing conferences: money
 
Relations between haves and have-nots in 2014 described as "class warfare"
 
"only some schools could afford to compete at the highest level, while others wanted to be at this level without the resources to be there"
 
"the amateur status of college athletes, which involves the legal treatment of them as students and which prohibits them from being paid as employees."  
Involves contradictions between the "collegiate model" and the "commercial model"  
Collegiate focuses on the interests of athletes as students, has some credibility in div III  
"Although athletic scholarships are construed by university and college sports officials as grants to support the education of big- time athletes, the fact that college athletes are paid on the basis of their ability to play a sport is in itself a contradiction of the collegiate model."
 
**FROM THE AIAW TO NCAA WOMEN'S SPORTS**
 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) had a meteoric rise and fall in the 70s and 80s  
Challenged NCAA  
Grew out of an earlier org, Commission on Intercollegiate Athletes for Women (CIAW)  
Began w/ a principled approach and high-minded goals  
Embraced an amateur model and respected rights of student-athletes  
Started drifting to a more competitive, professional, and commercial model as early as 73
 
"Title IX, which had created the interest in women’s sports that was needed to justify the investment of television and the golden triangle, ironically may have created an environment in which it was increasingly difficult for smaller institutions to compete successfully against much bigger ones"
 
AIAW grew faster because of no competition/interference from NCAA  
Its growth tempted NCAA to get involved in Women's sports
 
NCAA started offering women's championships for no extra cost AND TV packages for them  
AIAW declined by 20% in a few months (48% in Div I)  
Shut down by 82  
Females became less involved in woman's sports (lost jobs, worse titles, etc.)
 
**THE BUSINESS OF COLLEGE SPORTS IN THE INTERCOLLEGIATE GOLDEN TRIANGLE**
 
Golden triangle goes where the best branding and revenue opportunities are  
College athletics "embrace being in the commercial entertainment business, without necessarily acknowledging it"  
Colleges themselves aren't NECESSARILY strictly for-profit  
Also easier to measure accountability in sport vs academics
 
Early years of commercialized college sports:  
>Vague claims of a university's mission  
>presidents make vague claims about how sports support mission  
>actuallybecomefamousandmakemoney.jpg  
>"bargain with the devil" incident
 
Considered the athletic trap
 
Athletics promote university brand + produce revenue in a way academic programs cant
 
"The hold of big- time college sports may be so strong that it can sustain some of its biggest myths despite compelling contradictory evidence."
 
Athletic spending is only 3.8% of institutional budgets on average  
Still loses $6,000,000,000/year tho lulw  
Only 10-20% of universities generate enough to cover costs
 
Most institutions rely on subsidies  
Up to 85% can be covered  
Athletics is a big part of even div III institutions
 
Arms-race in big-time college sports  
Well-documented pattern of escalating spending  
"I have to outspend them to win"
 
"The problem is that athletics is structured to have winners and losers, and it can be difficult and very expensive to be a consistent winner"
 
"Overall, the salaries of FBS head football coaches rose 70 percent to an average of $1.64 million. In 2013, the average cost per win of football coaches in Big Five conferences was $259,409 in the Pac-12, $311,452 in the ACC, $357,278 in the Big Ten, $399,982 in the SEC, and $506,289 in the Big 12 (Trahan 2014)."
 
"the perceived need to compete and win, tradition, hope, and the athletic trap twist the logic of investment in big- time college sports. How do institutions afford the arms race? They struggle financially, rely on subsidies, and cut low- revenue or nonrevenue men’s sports to have more money for their top- tier sports"  
Women's sports are protected for fear of title IX lawsuits
 
Excess wealth doesn’t guarantee success, but it’s a shit ton easier than being poor

"As Clotfelter (2011:52) suggested, big- time college sports have never really been about or for students. For over a century, it has been commercialized mass entertainment organized primarily to serve the interests of the major institutional players in the golden triangle."

- Benefits universities
- Athletic programs
- Major conferences
- NCAA
- Media
- Businesses

"The hierarchy in many big- time athletic departments is football and men’s basketball at the top tier, women’s basketball at the next level, followed by an assortment of other sports that offer athletic scholarships and generate some revenue. The men’s and women’s programs that generate little or no revenue and offer few, if any, scholarships share a common low status. However, when Title IX is made an issue or more money is needed for struggling top- tier programs, lower- tier men’s programs are most likely to go on the chopping block and be cut."
