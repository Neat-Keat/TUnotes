Locations, structures, equipment, images/drawings  
Physical (biological)

Study human anatomy and its adaptability  
Bone size + stress fractures can give insights to physical activities  
Anthropological linguistics  
Study communication and human languages  
Language's role in human life  
How do people comm in sport vs elsewhere? Why?

Closest to Sociology of Sport  
Society vs Culture

Primary focus: CULTURE  
Culture is a total way of life  
Norms, values, symbols, knowledge  
How does sport convey a people's culture?  
How does society contextualize sport?

|---|---|
|Holistic Perspective|Knowing/accepting that any aspect of a culture is integrated with other aspects. No dimension of a culture can be understood in isolation.|
|Cultural Relativism|A cultural system or any aspect of that system can only be evaluated on its own terms. (promoted)|
|Ethnocentrism|The belief that one's own culture is the best and therefore the standard by which other cultures are consequently judged. (discouraged)|
