**PHILOSOPHY OF SPORT**
 
Philosophy: the search for truth/ wisdom (combo of knowledge + experience)  
Sport philosophers exist
 
"Are athletes philosophers?"  
Competition: to question/strive together  
Non-philosophers vs. Philosophers  
Socrates: "well I am certainly wiser than this man, it is only too likely that neither of us have any knowledge to boast of. But he thinks he knows something which he does not know, but I am conscious of my ignorance."
 
"I do not think that I know what I do not know"
 
Athletes don’t think they know that they'll win, they’ll compete to find out.

    - Body oriented
- Existentialism
    
    - On-going experience

Like giving a dog an office title?
