SPORT AND SOCIAL CLASS
 
Understanding The Impact of Social Class
 
Pierre Bordieu â€“ French Sociologist focused on Social Class, not necessarily sport tho

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Habitus|Lifestyle preferences associated w/ social class (specific taste/appreciation)  <br>Most professional athletes are from a middle class background  <br>Even though lower class communities value the body more|
|Capital|Resources, comes in a variety of forms. Cultural, economic, social, physical, etc. Transformable between types. (Money for the gym to network)|
|Field|Site/Location. Usually with a struggle over power or where a behavior plays out indicative of a social class.|
 
Annette Lareau  
Social Class & Parenting  
Did ethnographic work (fieldwork going into the location where subjects exist)  
How does social class habitus affect lives and behaviors of parents and children
 
Lower Class Child-Rearing -> "Natural Growth"  
Focus on setting clear boundaries between adult and child, less engagement, adult is authority. Kids get to pick what they're doing, where they're doing it, and who they're doing it with. They're much more autonomous. These kids have a heterogenous friend group
 
Middle Class Child-Rearing -> "Concerted Cultivation"  
Engagement between adult and child. Activities are seen as an attempt to grow/ cultivate the child. Parents have control and surveil. Much more homogeneous groups of kids.
 
This study shows SOCIAL CLASS _SUPERCEDES_ RACE
 
ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH ON SPORT AND SOCIAL CLASS
 
Comprehensive understanding of cultural practices through fieldwork  
Gain the emic perspective  
The public's view vs. private reality
 
Ethnography and Emic are anthropological term

Middle Class Parenting & Youth Sport (With Intersectionality thru gender, age, political/ economic sensibilities!)

1. "Soccer Mom" Phenomenon
    
    Mothers' supportive and labor-intensive role in sport: "unrecognized, undervalued, and mostly invisible"
    
      
    
    Informed by Bourdieu:  
    Mothers' use of various forms of capital in order to reproduce upper-middle-class habitus among their children.
    
    - The "Soccer Mom" Label (derogatory (I'm not a soccer mom, but she def is))
    - Investment and Commitment (having kids do sports requires a lot)
    - Flexibility (see above)
    - Producing "Good Boys" (I do it to teach my kids good values)
2. Boys in Soccer
3. Generation Y Girls in Sport
4. Youth-Sport-Performance Training Facilities
