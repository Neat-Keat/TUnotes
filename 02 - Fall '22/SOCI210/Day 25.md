- Increase in number of kids involved in youth sport

Reasons for increased # of kids in youth sport

4. Increased need for daycare – babysitting service, parents need to work longer hours (economy changes), more mothers work outside of home, divorce rates higher.
5. Social construct of "good parent" - meaning of good parent changed/evolved, more involved in child's life (concerted cultivation).
6. Kids are perceived as a danger to themselves – more immature, in need of more protection, older kids viewed as younger now.
7. Environment perceived as more dangerous – keeping kids out of trouble, concerned about events going on in environment, need for supervision
8. Growth in professional sports – increase number of professional sports leagues and teams, more info available, more opportunities, appeals to both parents and kids, something kid could do in future 
Performance Principle

11. Increasingly important in youth sport programs
12. Emphasis on – skill development and competitive success
13. Problematic for ~2/3 of kids
14. Specialization – athletes dedicate themselves exclusively to participation in a single sport and a single position within that sport
    
    - 7-14 year olds – 1/3 specialization is appropriate, 2/3 specialization is inappropriate; burn out (physical and mental health concerns)
    - Over use of body, sport becomes job, mentally exhausted

#1 Reason kids leave sport programs - "Its not fun", lack of control/autonomy
 
To Consider when designing youth sport programs  
Informal, player-controlled sports vs. Formal, adult-controlled sports
