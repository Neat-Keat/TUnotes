**YOUTH AND HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS**
 
"Soccer mom" is overgeneralized, but has some truth  
Fails to capture the diversity of women's parental roles, tells little abt how the kids exp sport.
 
This chapter is about how moms, dads, and other adults shape kids’ experiences in sports. It is also about how the culture and organization of adult- run sports in the community and in high schools affect the young people who compete in them.
 
This process is called "socialization"  
Involves social learning that affects how individuals form self-concepts, identities, and self-esteem.  
also enables people to interpret how culture and the social structure relate to their roles and relationships  
Lets people realize how they fit in.  
Contributes to social order, creates a basis for perceptions of order (issa loop)  
Is complex bc diff settings have diff cultural influences, structural arrangements, and socialization processes.  
Learning to be a brother /= learning to be a student  
Lifelong process
 
**Socialization and Sport**  
Teens in highly organized and competitive sport treated as "little adults"  
High expectations, little time to enjoy being teens, spend much time in training  
Golden triangle demands results, Susan  
Competitive/ elite programs leave deeper impressions on younger people.
 
Imprint of sport socialization can be seen from 2 perspectives:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Socialization into sport|social learning process that teaches the rules, roles, skills, and relationships that are needed to participate in a sport  <br>Affects proficiency, success, depth, and seriousness|
|Socialization thru sport|learning experiences that athletes take from sports participation into the rest of their lives￼ programs turning delinquents into "good boys"|
 
**Participation Patterns**  
Sociologists don’t care abt sports before HS  
Important to examine Youth Sports bc  
Large # of kids involved, involve so many adults, pursued seriously  
CAN SOCIALIZE THE MORE SERIOUS PARTICIPANTS  
"34% of girls and 61% of boys used sport for their identity"  
21.5mil kids who "frequently" do sports  
46.5mil in team sports in 2011  
54% of HS students do interscholastic athletics
 
"access to sports is not equal across genders, social classes, communities, or families. This is also true for poor racial and ethnic minorities. The effects of inequality are initially seen in childhood but are likely to be repeated through adolescence"
 
Youth sports can cause: "overall better health, positive body esteem, maintaining a healthy weight, popularity, more life satisfaction, and enhanced educational attainment"
 
Unless poor kids show unusual ability or promise, their parents wont help them
 
"involvement in multiple sports also raises questions about physical and emotional stresses on youth from trying to balance their assorted sports commitments with other after- school activities and school"  
Made worse by coaches demanding year-round commitment lol
 
Kids get involved bc: "parental pressure, peer influence, media sports coverage, urging from teachers or coaches, curiosity, or genuine interest"  
They learn: "sportsmanship, fair play, and competition"  
This reflects the attitudes of their parents and other adults  
Also shaped by contexts of cultural values and social organization of the sports they play
 
**Cross-National Similarities and Differences in Youth Sports Participation**  
Study sampling young athletes in suburban NY and Berlin  
Suggests globalization creates similar interests, but cultural influences create differences

|Berlin Boys  <br>Bicycling  <br>Table Tennis|Berlin Girls￼Bicycling￼Dancing￼Gymnastics|
 
Gender effects cross culturally:  
Girls played for fun, boys to win  
Only German girls didn’t practice regularly
 
**YOUTH SPORTS OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL AND IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE**
 
Independent leagues like Pop Warner and Little League have **BIG** sponsors, like Fortune 500 companies
 
"1bn/yr industry"
 
Pipelining kids to professional leagues  
Sponsoring kid's leagues has great public relations and marketing value  
More competitive = larger and more corporate sports organizations
 
"local soccer, basketball, football, baseball, tennis, or golf programs have ties to state, national, and sometimes international bodies that govern their sport"
 
Majority of youth participate, relatively few ascend to elite level of big-time corporate sports
 
"the organization of corporate youth sports tends to place more emphasis than recreational sports on (1) paid professional coaches; (2) selectivity mechanisms such as competitive tryouts; (3) fees for membership and access to facilities; (4) expensive clothing, equipment, coaching, training, and travel; (5) competitive intensity and the significance and rewards of winning; (6) sport specialization with mandatory year- round participation in practice, training, and competition; (7) spectators; and (8) commercial sponsorship. In addition, the organization of corporate youth sports is more likely to involve larger, more complex, and more bureaucratic structures and more external or nonlocal regulation and control. "
 
Some young folk drop out to pursue alternative/ extreme sports, like BMX  
Ch4 looks at extreme sports were transformed from alternative recreational subcultures into highly organized and commercialized sports with professional athletes.
 
"The researchers studied a group of young people who participated in BMX riding in two different types of settings: (1) a grassroots context where the more experienced riders set up the ramps, courses, and jumps themselves and (2) a BMX indoor/outdoor riding circuit at a skate park that was organized as a corporate commercial venture by adults to make money by providing a safe place to practice BMX riding skills. In contrast to the commercial site, the grassroots site did not cost money to participate and was free from adult supervision, organization, and interference. In addition, the riders could take risks and ride as they wished at the grassroots site. Because they were freer from external adult intervention, their own site was more play- like and relaxed, and the riders were more spontaneous and more cooperative and helpful toward each other."
 
Riders moved in and out of both venue types  
Bc of marketing lol
      

"The involvement of the golden triangle also implies that youth sports are a segment of the economy, which should elevate their perceived importance."

"Socialization into sport can lead to socialization through sport when youth sports are pursued seriously over a number of years"

![Probe 6.1: Variations in Youth Sports Participation Among those who did not participate in organized sports in the community or school in Sabo and Veliz's sample, 18 percent of girls and 13 percent of boys never participated and 13 percent of girls and 12 percent of boys had dropped out. Boys' participation was highest in the third to fifth grades (79 percent), dropped off somewhat in middle school (77 percent), and significantly declined again in high school (70 percent for ninth and tenth graders and 69 percent for juniors and seniors). Among girls, partici- pation increased from the primary grades of three to five (70 percent) to middle school (72 percent), and then dropped off in high school (68 percent in grades nine and ten and 64 percent in grades eleven and twelve). About 27 percent of girls and 41 per- cent of boys were involved in three or more sports. Participation rates were higher in suburban than in urban and rural schools. This should not surprise us in view of our discussion in Chapter 3 of the financial struggles of schools in lower-income urban and rural areas (see Sabo and Veliz 2012). Sabo and Veliz concluded from their findings about youth sports participation patterns in Go Out and Play that girls who lived in urban areas and grew up in lower-income single-parent families were least likely to be involved in youth sports because they faced the greatest social obstacles to participation. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202829-0.png)

"Nearly all students in US public schools were exposed to a heavy emphasis on organized and team sports, especially at the high school level. Whereas in Germany, students had relatively little experience with interscholastic sports, and physical education classes may have been their only exposure to organized physical activity."

![Probe 6.2: The Golden Triangle and Chasing the American Sports Dream in Elite Youth Basketball There may be no better example of the influence of the golden triangle on youth sports than elite youth basketball leagues in the United States. Elite youth basketball had been dominated for many years by the AAU , which is a nonprofit organization. However, in the 1980s, adidas and other athletic shoe manufacturers began to invest in youth basketball. "Ihey established all-star camps where aspiring basketball stars could dis- play their talent and pursue their American Sports Dreams. Having concentrated on the professional level, Nike found itself behind its competitors in the youth market at the turn of the twenty-first century. In 2010, it made its big move into this market by spending millions of dollars on the creation of an elite league—the EYBL—modeled on the National Basketball Association (NBA). By 2014, this league was called "the sport's largest incubator of teenage talent" (Wiedeman 2014). Ihe EYBL and other elite leagues and camps provide opportunities for coaches and referees as well as athletes to climb the sports ladder. It is also an opportunity for businesses and sponsors in the golden triangle to increase their brand visibility. Teams get cash from sponsors such as Nike, adidas, and Under Armour to outfit players in sneakers with their logos. Competitive venues are filled with company representatives handing out their products to players, who become billboards for the logos they wear. Thus, elite youth basketball is a junior golden triangle, with intense competition on the court, big-time recruiting, media expo- sure, substantial financial investments by sponsors and private donors, and athletes 176 Social Contexts of Sport as commodities. Ihere is even corruption such as under-the-table payments to get top players. The commercialization of this realm poses ethical and practical dilemmas for the truly altruistic. At least some of the individuals who have been involved with these elite teams have seen them as a means to lift talented players out of poverty and into a better life, but they have also recognized the seamier commercial aspects, the stress on young athletes' bodies, and the inevitable disappointment many were likely to experi- ence (Wiedeman 2014). However, the reality is that making it into the golden triangle at the college and pro levels makes competing in this kind of commercial environment a near necessity for aspiring youths. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202829-1.png)
