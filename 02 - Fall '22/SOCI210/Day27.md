**EXPERIENCES OF COLLEGE ATHLETES**
 
College sports are NOT all the same

- They can vary by NCAA Division
- They can vary within division
   

**Characteristics of NCAA Div I Programs**

- Emphasize Football/ Men's Basketball (Except Div I-AAA)
- Most of these Div I programs lose money (>80%)
    
    - Only around 70 schools reliably make money off of athletics
- Almost Â½ Div I athletes have scholarships
    
    - Half of this has a full ride (total of 25%)
        
        - Should student-athletes be paid if they aren't on scholarship?
- Time and energy commitments to sport are Very High, they must choose between:
    
    - Working out and practicing sport
        
        - Athletes donâ€™t know what they're getting into
        - Donâ€™t know how different div I is from II and III
    - Doing coursework
    - Engaging in social activities
- Athletes tend to drop 1 of these three
    
    - Usually coursework ðŸ˜Š
- Academic detachment is a commonly used coping strategy among male athletes   
   

**Varsity Athletes in Most College Programs (Div II and III)**

- Time and energy commitments vary greatly depending on coaches and sports
- Most play without athletic scholarships
- Less likely to be separated from the rest of the student body (compared to div I)  
**Graduation Rates Among (Div I) College Athletics**

- Varsity athletes vs all students
- Lowest in revenue producing sports
 
**Gender and Race**
 
- Female athletes have higher grad rates than male athletes
- Black athletes have grad rates higher than black students as a whole, but lower than rates for white athletes
 
**Indirect Benefits of Intercollegiate Programs**

- High Profile sport teams can be used in connection with fund raising efforts
- Sport teams may attract attention among potential students
    
    - Specifically non-athletes
    - Sports teams are a form of marketing
        
        - Does this mean we should pay student athletes?
    - Can cause manipulative admin (ethical issue)
        
        - Use sport programs to get a bunch of applicants, then gatekeep them from entering (turn into an elite university?)
        - Almost happened at towson lol
- Sports provide on-campus social events and occasions
 
College athletic GPAs are dependant on intersectionality, including  
Race  
Gender  
Sport  
Division  
Etc
 
In general, they have lower grades though (?)
