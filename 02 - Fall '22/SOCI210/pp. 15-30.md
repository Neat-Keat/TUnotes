Sociologists use theories to construct understandings of society that explain its major social patterns, problems, and issues.
 
Micro theories v Macro theories
 
Theories lead to changes in policy, but aren't knowledge until backed up with evidence of success
 
Sociology does NOT only use 1 perspective/ theory

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES:
 
Structural functionalist:  
Sport is an institution, so how do institutionalized social patterns work in sport?  
Emile Durkheim - 19th century France  
"Norms, statuses, roles, and relationships arise in social networks because people need certain things to happen in order for their groups, organizations, or the larger society to survive and be effective. "  
Girls aren't typically allowed to play aggressive sports > reinforces typical gender roles > maintains established gender structures in society
 
Social conflict and critical theory:  
Macro perspective  
Focus on broad patterns of inequality  
Esp. dominant groups exploiting weaker groups  
Derived from Marxism
 
Neo-Marxist critical theory  
focus on how contemporary bureaucracies and patterns of scientific, legal, and organizational rationality exploit and dehumanize human beings.  
Illegal/unethical training/drugs to enhance performance  
Turns athletes into robots of scientific sport philosophy  
"Flesh Engine"
 
Marxist theory  
Uses Marxism (see top) to explain how capitalist owners exploit their athletes, and how athletes respond with union activity, etc. as a collective
 
Feminist Theory  
Focus on structures of patriarchy and male domination  
Patriarchy and male privilege is only continued on the basis of sexist ideology and patterns of gender inequality
 
Critical race and ethnic theory  
Similar to Feminist theory, but focuses on racial and ethnic inequalities and racism.
   

INTERACTIONIST THEORY  
Focus on the micro Level, unlike all previous examples
 
Symbolic interactionists:  
Refers to the construction and exchange of meanings in social interaction through which we define ourselves, our roles, and our experiences in society  
Charles Horton Cooley and George Herbert Mead, 20th century  
Focuses on how we form ideas about ourselves, understand others’ expectations for us that are embedded in social roles, and perceive the expectations of society that are incorporated in social norms, ranging from informal everyday rules for interaction to highly formalized regulations and laws.  
People with authority's views on you can impact your social status  
If a rich man likes you, you get to hang out with other rich people  
If a rich man doesn't like you, he can stop you from moving up the social ladder  
Dramaturgical approach  
Erving Goffman’s (1959, 1967)  
Social life is like a theater  
We are all actors, making scripts up on the fly to keep interactions smooth  
FRONT STAGE v BACK STAGE behavior  
We try harder to play the character when being widely observed "on front stage", then in the back where no one is watching  
Public image v private image
 
Postmodern critical theory  
Focuses on problems associated with:  
individualism  
rationality  
objectivity  
scientific progress  
democracy  
meritocracy  
Violence  
Postmodern perspectives make us realize the declining influence of history
   

"We will rely on a mix of structural functional, conflict, critical, and interactionist perspectives that help us see and understand these aspects of sport. We will not ignore the postmodernist criticisms, however. These perspectives will be especially useful in helping us to see and understand the major forces of change that are shaping and reshaping sport and society. In combination, they will enable us to focus on sport and society from the micro level of social relationships to the macro levels of interactions between and among leagues, sports, and even nations."

Societal institutions such as sport have the broad function of contributing to the life, vitality, and orderly organization of the society.
 
Inherently conservative in nature  
Preserves old traditions that maintain social stability

"Closely related to Hoberman’s critique of scientific rationality is George Ritzer’s critical analysis of rationality in modern versions of bureaucracy, which he called “McDonaldization.” This kind of organization drew its inspiration from the McDonald’s restaurant chain and became the model for many other businesses and organizations. Ritzer (2011) referred to the “irrationality of rationality” in his critique of McDonaldization. He argued that the ostensibly rational organizational structures of McDonaldization become irrational when they suppress human individualism, creativity, choice, and freedom. Thus, both the iron cage and the irrationality of rationality deprive people of a sense of control over their roles in organizations."

MARXISM:  
Focuses on power imbalance between owner and worker  
>Owners want to maximize profit  
>Owners cut costs on employees  
>Employees are exploited  
>Capitalism bad

"While not necessarily explicitly rooted in classic Marxism, contemporary critical theories incorporate elements of Marxist conflict theory in their emphases on conflicts or struggles over ideology, status, power, or economic advantage involving minorities and women."

"Structural functionalists see existing social and cultural patterns in terms of their functional value to an entire group, organization, society, or other social system. Social conflict and critical theorists tend to see these patterns in terms of how they advantage certain social classes, strata, races, or ethnic groups over others or advantage men over women"
 
Structural functionalism focuses on what unites and benefits society  
Social conflict theorists focus on what divides and contributes to power imbalances  
Also focus on the conditions necessary to fight these norms for a more fair society

DONALD BALL  
Study on how athletes cope with being cut and  
How the Grim Reaper delivers the news to the cutee
 
Baseball sends players to minor leagues  
Players see it as degrading/ embarrassing  
Other athletes avoid them to maintain social status
 
In "One-Tier sports" without a minor league, players are less embarassed  
Out of the public eye  
Former teammates treat with more sympathy
    
In general, interactionists share the basic approach of all interpretive sociologists in their primary focus on “human agency,” or how we actively construct and reconstruct social reality in an ongoing process of social negotiation (Donnelly 2002).

"Andrews (2000) proposed that these critical perspectives represented a new way of thinking about sport and doing sport sociology. He suggested that they shift our attention away from the structural analyses of both functionalism and Marxism and away from neo- Marxist and other structural critiques of modern society that focus on the intertwining of the political and the economic in political economy, the dominance of large- scale rational organizations of the modern state and economy, the influence of modern culture, and the various political, economic, and social inequalities of the postmodern era."

Sport as a global corporate structure

SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODS:  
Cause and Effect  
(1) experiments  
>Change an independent variable  
>dependent variable also changes  
> Hypotheses proven  
>success.jpg  
Usually natural, not in a lab setting
 
(2) social surveys  
Poll representative samples that reflect the whole body  
Non-representative samples can be dangerous and misleading  
Loses credibility if questions are skipped, answers are intentionally "wrong", etc.  
Statistical analysis, rather than the manipulation of the research setting, is the basis for drawing conclusions about cause and effect.
 
(3) field studies  
Using careful observations/ unstructured interviews to gather data  
Usually used by Interactionist perspectives  
Case Study:  
Describes prominent and recurring social patterns and processes in groups, organizations, or wider social networks
 
Research quality strongly affected by interviewer's skills + interviewee's interpretations  
Hard to get participants  
Attachment to participants causes loss of objectivity  
Case Studies in particular are so narrow that they may lose their generalizability
 
(4) secondary data analysis.  
Analyzing other people's findings for new insights unrelated to the original purpose.  
Content Analysis:  
an interpretation of the meaning of the sounds, images, or words in these data sources  
"Used to identify social trends, correlations, or even causes"  
Issues with Validity and Reliability
      

**The accumulation of sociological evidence about sport and society, in combination with theoretical analysis of its meaning, represents the body of knowledge in sport sociology. This body of knowledge is the focus of this book.**
 
Sport Sociologists have to convince people that not everything is true/ needs more qualification  
We don’t know much  
Much to learn  
Why should their views overturn coaches' views?  
Sociological research is based in hard data and objectivity, unlike salty, subjective fans

**Structural Analysis of Social Networks in Sport Sociology**
 
Social network analysis:
 
An approach for studying social connections or social ties (see Nixon 2002)  
Not really a theory, rather an analytic framework that reveals the structural “skeleton” of society.  
Social network analysts measure the relative strength or weakness of social ties, which is the amount of commitment to social ties and the value we place on them.
 
Social Capital  
Implies that having connections gives someone power
 
Connections are everything lol
 
How is sport tied to mass media?  
Provides people:  
Visibility  
Information  
Money
 
GOLDEN TRIANGLE
 
The golden triangle is a product of global capitalism and is oriented primarily to expanding commercial markets and generating profits.
 
Can refer to all levels, not just globally
 
**refers to a dominant power structure within the global cultural economy of capitalism operating in some commercialized domain of sport.**  
Little League, Inc., influences how young boys and girls participate in baseball in communities throughout the United States and many other countries
 
golden triangles may compete economically with other golden triangles that are operating in their markets and perhaps on a larger scale as well
 
often formally affiliated with larger corporate organizations that are part of larger- scale golden triangles.
 
all likely to be controlled by the same kinds of people and organizations, which embrace the same kinds of cultural values and general economic interests  
typically have the same kind of influence on sport, on people in the sports world, and on sports consumers.  
Implies one loosely integrated golden triangle network that includes an array of commercial sports, media operations, and corporate sponsors and business investors and has common values and interests.  
Goal is to just make more money lol

**"Thus, when we think of sport throughout this book, it is important to remember that the games, the athletes, the coaches, and the spectators are less important than the people and practices that make money, contribute to prestige, and enhance power for the organizations that control sports in the golden triangle."**
