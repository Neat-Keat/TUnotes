**USER INTERFACES**
 
A UI is any system that supports human-machine interaction (HMI) or human computer interaction (HCI)  
Exists as both hardware AND software, as well as input AND output
 
INTERACTIVITY  
Interactivity: reciprocal comm between media and users facilitated by tech  
Implies both interaction and activity  
Replaces 1 way flow of info with 2 way interaction  
Gives users a chance to choose what they need and want  
Makes users the source of info  
Gives users agency to contribute to creating media  
Helps UIs stick better
 
TYPES OF UI  
Command Line Interfaces (CLI)  
Demand technological know-how  
Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
Includes windows, icons, menus, buttons, and scrolling bars  
Web User Interfaces (WUI)  
Most widely used GUI  
Use HTML, CSS, scripting, programming, and applications to enhance user interaction  
Touch Interfaces  
Use touch screens as combined I/O devices  
Single touch vs multi touch  
Voice Interfaces  
Popularized by phones, which have siri n shit  
Motion Tracking interfaces  
Wiis and kinects  
Augmented Reality (AR)  
Superimposing computer generated text, praphics, audio, GPS data, etc., atop your view of the real world environment in real time  
Google Glass  
Baidu Eye - Chinese rival to Google Glass
 
**UI COMPONENTS AND FEATURES**
 
NAVIGATION
 
Primary Navigation
 
Organizes content users are most interested in by major topical headings/labels  
Usually placed above the fold  
Can be horizontal or vertical  
Most commonly used element is a menu
 
Secondary Navigation
 
Organizes less-often-visited content  
Found almost anywhere  
Should use different color, font, and size from primary  
Includes tabs, footers, and breadcrumbs
 
Menus
 
Can be horizontal, vertical, accordion  
Space efficient
 
Vertical Dropdown Menus
 
Horizontal stripe that drops down when hovered/clicked  
Follow the 3 menu rule pls  
Add delay between hovering off and collapsing the menu
 
Horizontal Dropdown Menus
 
Same as vertical, just rotated lol  
Subsections appear to the right
 
Accordions
 
Vertically/horizontally stacked list of sections  
When a section is clicked it expands to show more info, other sections collapse to compensate  
Limit sections to prevent scrolling
 
Tabs
 
Used when a UI needs access to different content modules/ sections  
Similar to labeling folders in a file cabinet  
Easy to show large amounts of info by category  
Doesn’t require refreshing  
Appropriate when users DON’T have to see info in diff tabs at the same time  
Create a limited # of tabs  
Keep labels short  
Avoid more than one row  
Use a visual cue to distinguish current tab
 
**MANAGING THE HIERARCHY**
 
HOME LINKS
 
Sends users to home page  
Put it in a consistent spot
 
BREADCRUMBS
 
Gives users a way to track their path and go back up the hierarchy  
Usually for complicated UIs  
Typically right below the navigation menus in a horizontal line  
Styled to be small and plain  
Should NEVER replace tabs or menus  
Secondary navigation aid
 
FOOTERS
 
Provides continuous access to shortcuts to highly used sections, as well as major functions that are important to users regardless of location in the site  
ONLY used as secondary navigation
 
**ORGANIZING CONTENT**
 
THUMBNAILS
 
Reduced-size version of a larger image  
Can illustrate any visual item  
Used to overview all visual content without clicking on them  
Saves download time and bandwidth  
Must successfully convey intended meaning
 
CAROUSELS
 
Organize content on a visual line, only showing a few at a time  
Direct focus on fewer objects at a time  
More effective for visual items, like album and book covers, posters, and paintings, NOT TEXT
 
PAGINATION
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525202900-0.png)  

Lets users anticipate amount of info  
Highlight current page pls  
Say total # of pages pls  
Include 1st and last page pls
 
ARCHIVES
 
Organizes content chronologically  
Only appropriate when info spans a LONG time, and its logical  
Wayback Machine is great
 
Parallax Scrolling
 
**FORMS**
 
Enter info, get feedback  
Keep them short and intuitive  
Don’t ask for sensitive info lol
 
You can use:

- Checkboxes
    
    - Select multiple options
- Radio buttons
    
    - Choose among mutually exclusive options
- Dropdown lists
    
    - Same as radio but with more options
- Text Fields
 
You can use:  
Autofill, prompt prefills, and tabbing
 
**TAILORING**
 
2 kinds:  
**PERSONALIZATION**  
System makes changes  
Using previous actions to predict interests  
Relies on implicit interests rather than explicit ones  
Powered by data  
Questionnaires or data mining  
Can be identified thru cookies  
Collaborative Filtering  
Uses your profile AND your actions, compares to similar users, and adjusts your page
 
**CUSTOMIZATION**  
User makes changes  
Gives users agency  
Can be cosmetic or functional
 
**USABILITY**  
Measure of people's experience with a UI  
Applies to ANYTHING a user uses, from software to hardware  
Focuses on how to make the interface EASIER to use, not how to train people to use bad UI  
5 criteria  
**LEARNABILITY**  
How fast a user can accomplish basic tasks on a new UI  
Better when familiar, generalizable, predictable, consistent, and simple  
**EFFICIENCY**  
How fast a user can perform tasks on a learned UI  
Saves users time  
**MEMORABILITY**  
How easily can a user remember where to go  
Familiar visual cues make a UI more learnable and memorable  
**ERROR MANAGEMENT**  
Reduces # of errors users might make  
Decreases the severity of each error  
Makes recovering from an error easy  
**SATISFACTION**  
How pleasant is the UX?  
Subjective
 
Usability is an essential constraint  
NEVER the enemy of creativity
 
**USABILITY TESTING**
 
Conduct during prototyping  
Catch 80% of problems with 5-8 good users and well-designed tests

1. Unobtrusive observation
    
    1. Watch without talking, only recording reactions
2. Think aloud protocols (obtrusive observation)
    
    1. Encourage them to talk abt their exp as they interact with the interface
 
Use a script lol  
Make it comfortable  
"the UI is tested, not you"  
Give 1+ tasks  
Make them interact with:

- Main menu and submenus
- Interactive components
- Ext + informative statements
- Images (esp. icons)
 
Interviews AND questionnaires are great for feedback
 
**SOLICITING AND APPLYING FEEDBACK**
 
Ask users what they find problematic  
Avoid helping  
Neutral prompting is okay  
Use test findings to refine ideas, make changes, and improve UI
 
**RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN**
 
Building a website that works for every devise with optimal display regardless of screen size
 
1 accessible site has better SEO than 2 non-accessible sites
 
**MAKING INTERFACES ACCESSIBLE**
 
Accessibility is a fundamental principle of UI design  
Accessibility addresses all kinds of disabilities  
Visual, spatial, physical, cognitive problems  
Screen readers cant work on images without alt text  
"Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their information technology, such as websites, accessible to people with disabilities"  
"Section 255 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act also calls for electronic media to be made accessible"  
Universal design from DSFT lol  
Design UIs to work on older tech as well  
Separating content from its presentation makes it easier to make it accessible  
CSS baybee!
   
 
UI vs UX  
UI focuses on interactable elements  
UX is broader, describes how a user feels  
Umbrella term that encompasses UI

"In user interfaces, we most commonly find those features that 1) classify categories and create sections, such as menus and tabs; 2) manage the hierarchy, helping users move within the structure of an interface, such as home links, breadcrumbs, and footers; and 3) organize content, such as thumbnails, carousels, pagination, archives, and tag clouds. "

ABOVE THE FOLD DESIGN  
Put important shit above where people have to scroll to

![Great Ideas Accessibility and Usability Accessibility is related to usability. However, accessibility should not be confused with usability. Whereas usability refers to designing an effective, efficient, and satisfying interface, accessibility focuses on allowing more people, especially those with disabilities, to use that interface circumstances. under more ](Exported%20image%2020240525202900-3.png)
