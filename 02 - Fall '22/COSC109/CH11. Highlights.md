Recording Formats and Device Settings
 
Highlights:

- Evolution of analog and digital videotape recording formats
- The transition from tape-based recording formats to file-based recording formats
- Open and proprietary standards for encoding digital audio and video files
- The difference between compressed and uncompressed audio and video file formats
- FWIGSS-six basic camcorder settings everyone should understand
 
.wav  
.aif  
.mp3  
.mov  
.m4v  
Etc
 
LEGACY TV RECORDING FORMATS  
TV broadcasts used to be streams lol  
Ampex Corporation invented the world's first open-reel audio tape recorder in 1948  
1st commercial videotape recorder 8 years later, VRX-1000 or Mark IV
 
VIDEOTAPE  
Tiny magnetic strips  
4 tracks:  
Video Track  
Audio Tracks  
1 for mono  
2 for stereo  
Control Track  
Stores info to keep playback speed proper
 
ANALOG TAPE FORMATS  
1970s: Electronic News Gathering (ENG) & Electronic Field Production (EFP), VHS and U-Matic  
Copying off of an analog copy deteriorated the copy - called generation loss
 
DIGITAL TAPE FORMATS  
1980s: no more generation loss
 
All legacy formats recorded in SD:  
NTSC: 720 x 486  
PAL: 720 x 576
 
1990's HD formats become available, but v expensive  
D5HD and HDCAM are HD (1440 x 1080)  
HDV is popular and just a downscaling of these
 
FILE-BASED RECORDING FORMATS  
Everything is stored in solid-state storage  
Bitstream: sequence of bits used to represent individual video or audio signals
 
CODECS AND CONTAINER FORMATS  
Encoding: numerically representing a multimedia asset in binary form  
Codec: an encoding format  
Specially created file format to arrange bits to conform to a particular standard  
Short for COder DECoder  
Decoding: unscrambling a codec for accurate playback  
Transcoding: changing a file from one codec to another
 
Multimedia container: bundles and stores raw bitstreams  
Container formats support multiple codecs  
Apple QuickTime  
Supports:

1. GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF
2. AIFF, AAC, MP3, WAV
3. AVCHD, DV, MPEG-4, H.264, .mov

Any file can be played in a QuickTime player  
Some codecs are designed to compress (like mp3!)
 
DIGITAL AUDIO ENCODING  
Analog methods are better because they record sound more organically
 
PULSE-CODE MODULATION (PCM)  
British engineer Alec Reeves in 1937  
Originally to reduce noise over telephone lines  
Sample, and send samples instead of a continuous sound  
Fidelity is determined by:

1. Sample rate (kHz)
2. Bit depth
3. Bit rate

Must be +2X the frequency range of the signal being recorded  
Humans hear 20hz-20kHz, so minimum sample rate should be 40kHz  
Anything less and sounds are lost, any higher and you're wasting bits  
44.1 kHz became industry standard  
Affects dynamic range + amount of noise + distortion introduced during recording process  
16 bit/24 bit  
700,600 bits/second in 16bit as compared to 2.3million in 24  
Quantization: assigning discrete numerical values to each voltage measurement
 
Transmission speed of a compressed audio stream during playback (Kbps)  
MP3 is 16-320 Kbps  
bigger means better with larger file sizes  
(too high causes buffering)  
128 Kbps is the minimum for hi-fidelity (256 is better lol)  
AVOID RECORDING AUDIO IN A COMPRESSED FORMAT (.AIFF OR .WAV)
 
OPEN STANDARDS FOR VIDEO AND AUDIO ENCODING  
Open Standard: publicly released spec set used in the design of a product, process, or protocol  
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  
All created the World Standards Cooperation in 2001
 
ISO and IEC jointly established MPEG
 
MPEG-1 AUDIO LAYER III (MP3)  
1993  
Part 3 of a 5 part standard  
10x compression over WAV and AIF  
Lossy (discard 90% of original data)
 
MPEG-2 (H.262)  
1996  
Encode SF and HD video at significantly higher bitrate than MPEG-1  
DVDs replaced VHS  
￼ADVANCED AUDIO CODING (AAC)  
Dolby Digital = AC3  
Supports 7.1 audio channels  
Dolby Digital 5.1 is a 6-channel broadcast, cinema, and home theater standard  
Distributes audio to 5 normal-range speakers (L-C-R) in the front and (L-R) in the back AND 1 Subwoofer  
7.1 adds 2 side-mounted speakers  
MPEG-4  
1998-2014  
30 part standard  
Most important is AVC (H.264) ((MP4)  
Technically H.264 is the video compression codec and MP4 is the container format  
H.264 compresses a lot with great picture quality, so its industry standard
 
High Efficiency Video Coding/H.265  
UHDTV has 4-16x the pixels as HD  
H.265 was developed to replace H.264 and support up to 8K  
Has 2x the compression performance too!
 
PROPRIETARY STANDARDS FOR VIDEO AND AUDIO ENCODING  
Proprietary formats are designed to only work with specific equipment or computer software.  
Professional Disc, SxS, and P2 are all expensive and high-end  
Camera determines which codec or format is used during recording
 
SxS  
Solid-state memory card format that combines fast flash memory with a PCI Express case.  
SxS-1 is a cheaper alternative, but last shorter  
SxS Pro+ supports 4k video
 
P2  
Solid-state memory card format  
Multiple SD cards enclosed in a PCMCIA card case  
microP2 works with SDHC/SDXC memory card specs
 
RED  
RED MINI-MAG SSD stores 512 GB  
REDMAG stores 48, 64, or 240 GB  
RED cinema cameras have filmed The Hobbit
 
AVCHD  
Based on MPEG-4  
AVCHD Lite records 720p
 
QUICKTIME  
Media player AND multimedia container format since 1991  
MPEG-4 based almost entirely on QuickTIme  
Means .mov and .mp4 are basically the same
 
WAV and AIFF  
Both similar  
Rival proprietary container formats, but largely interchangeable and both are supported virtually everywhere
 
FORMATTING MEMORY CARDS  
Initialize or format cards or drives before the first shot  
It erases all data on the card, so make sure important stuff is backed up to a hard drive  
Best practice is formatting on the device you record on, not a standalone computer
 
RECORDING FORMAT  
WAV > MP3 because its uncompressed
 
VIDEO ENCODING SETTINGS  
Resolution  
HD is 1920x1080 or 1080i or 1080p  
SD is 1280x720 or 720i or 720p  
Scanning Method  
Interlaced or Progressive  
Shoot in p unless specifically told to shoot in I  
It's sharper and conforms closer to current industry standards  
Frame Rate  
US TV is 30/24 fps  
Bit Rate  
24, 17, 9, and 5 are typical bitrates
 
AUDIO ENCODING SETTINGS  
Linear PCM, AAC, or Dolby AC3  
LPCM is uncompressed  
In general, select the highest quality uncompressed format available (like WAV!)  
"A professional would never choose MP3 ov er WAV or AIFF
 
FWIGSS  
Basic to-do list when setting up cameras

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Focus|Sharp = in focus  <br>Soft = blurry  <br>Unintentionally blurry subjects are BAD  <br>Ride the focus: continually adjusting focus while keeping the shot focused  <br>Autofocus _can_ work, but can also focus wrong subject, roll/shift thru movement, lose focus on reflective/complex subjects, not work in low-light/contrast  <br>Manual Focus:<br><br>1. Compose shot<br>2. Zoom in as far as you can on subjects eyes<br>3. Adjust focus until eyes are sharply in focus<br>4. Zoom back out to compose shot|
|White Balance|AWB can fail, do custom WB  <br>Focus on a white card/paper, then set WB|
|Iris|Auto iris functions are "pretty good"  <br>Neutral Density (ND) Filters can act like sunglasses for cameras  <br>Zebra Stripes is a feature that covers overexposed areas with a zebra stripe pattern  <br>Corresponds to a broadcast engineering standard  <br>7.5 IRE is video black, while 100 IRE is peak white before clipping  <br>Keep levels between these two and you're good  <br>Each F-stop = 15 IRE  <br>White people are expected to be 60-70 IRE :skull:|
|Gain|0 dB, +6 dB, and +12 dB  <br>Amplifies the voltage level of the composite video signal  <br>Each 6 dB doubles light sensitivity AND noise  <br>Equivalent to 1 full F-stop  <br>Optimal position is 0 dB  <br>Practically the same as ISO|
|Shutter Speed|Shutter speed of 1/250 means shutter opens and closes 250x/second  <br>Should be 2x the frame rate of video  <br>30fps -> 1/60  <br>Doesn't alter frame rate tho lul  <br>Use higher shutter speeds for movement and lower for slower|
|Sound|Connections and Signal Flow<br><br>Use external mics for interviews<br><br>2. Pick a location relatively free of background noise<br>3. Listen for transmission noise caused by ground loops, RF interference, Phase cancelation, or electrical shorts (THRU HEADPHONES)<br>4. Make sure the mic is turned on 4head<br>5. Make sure XLR cable connectors are fully seated on both ends and securely in place<br>6. Make sure condenser mics have working batteries or phantom power is turned on<br>7. Confirm preamp is set to an appropriate level (no clipping!)<br>8. Connect headphones to input jack and set to an appropriate volume<br>9. Try swapping out cables or mics if you need to troubleshoot<br>10. Sound check<br><br>Check to make sure its being read on VU meter & you can hear it  <br>Monitoring audio without headphones is NOT an option, unless you don’t care about results|
