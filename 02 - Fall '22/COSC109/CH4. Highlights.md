This chapter examines:  
The process of visual communication (vis-com)  
The role of content + form in visuals  
8 elements of visual design:  
Space  
Dot  
Line  
Shape  
Form  
Texture  
Attern  
Color  
12 principles of visual design:  
Unity:  
Proximity  
Alignment  
Similarity  
Repetition  
Emphasis:  
Contrast  
Color  
Depth  
Proportion  
Perceptual Forces:  
Balance  
Continuation  
Figure-ground  
Psychological closure
 
Visual communication:  
Investigates the transmission of ideas + info thru visual forms + symbols  
Looks at the processes behind perception of stimuli  
Perception != seeing  
Perception is the transmission of culture and meaning  
Seeing is about the objective realities of sight
 
Content: the tangible essence of a work  
Stories, ideas, and info we exchange  
Form: the manner in which content is shared and consumed  
Influenced by target audience
 
Both are complementary components of visual design  
Form should reduce eyestrain and guide audiences thru info quickly
 
"The medium is the message" -Marshall McLuhan  
"Content is King" -Bill Gates
 
LESS IS MORE:  
Promotes healthy self-restraint  
Adding useless bells and whistles because "they're cool" lowers product effectiveness  
Impairs UX  
Impairs Usability  
Impairs Satisfaction
 
Aesthetics:  
Perception influences Judgement  
"I'll buy the red car because its better than the blue car"  
Applied Aesthetics gives cinematography, graphic design, etc. specific guidelines to follow  
Allows for critical examination of work based on objective standards  
More feedback is better :mindblown:  
Goal of feedback is to objectively asses creative output to optimize a message's effectiveness, not attacking the designer lulw
 
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN:  
Design: the strategic arrangement of visual elements to form a unified & wholistic impression  
Aka composition  
Design does NOT have to incorporate all 8 elements
 
SPACE:  
Canvas in painting, Field of View ion photography  
2 Dimensional, xy counts with the top-left as (0,0)  
Depth is an illusion lulw  
An image lacking depth is called flat  
Conforms to an aspect ratio, like 4:3 or 16:9, to prevent distortion

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Positive Space|Portion of an image w/ visual elements|
|Negative Space|No visual elements, synonym for white space￼essential bc it adds breathing room, which improves readability|
 
DOT  
Most basic representation of form  
Can be combined to make anything  
Like lines lol  
Halftone Images are just black dots of different sizes to portray things  
Evolved into CMYK printing  
Photosite: light sensitive diode that registers light intensity as binary  
Reproduced w/ pixels  
LINE  
Connects 2 points in space  
Real or implied  
Used to stir emotions / create specific mood or atmosphere
 
Straight Lines  
Static  
Horizontal  
Peaceful and calm  
Natural and reliable reference point  
Reinforce balance and stability  
Vertical  
Sense of power, strength, grandeur, and awe  
Dynamic  
Diagonal  
Sense of speed, movement, and depth  
Curved Lines  
Sense of peace & tranquility  
Easy to follow  
Accentuate shape and form
 
Leading lines steer eyes thru a design, guiding between elements
 
SHAPE  
2D element formed by the enclosure of dots and lines  
Basic shapes are circles, triangles, and squares  
Geometric v Organic  
Can evoke memories of attached emotions
 
FORM:  
3D  
Circles -> spheres, squares -> cubes  
Created in 2D by manipulating lighting, shading, color, and contrast
 
LIGHTING:  
Affects form  
Characterized by:  
Intensity  
Overall brightness  
Color temp  
Overall hue, measured in kelvin?  
Hardness  
Overall sharpness of edges
 
TEXTURE:  
Surface attribute of an object that evokes tactile interaction  
Implied in images  
Can stir up emotions and associations, like shape  
Breaks up visual monotony  
Enhances interest + perceived realism
 
PATTERN:  
Reoccurrence of a visual element  
Adds visual interest to plain objects
 
COLOR:  
Hue  
Color shade  
Saturation  
Color intensity  
Value  
Color darkness
 
We use color to set tone and mode, elicit associations, attract attention, and help remember things

PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN:  
UNITY:  
Proximity:  
Close objects are perceived as related :O  
Alignment:  
Position related objects along a common edge or implied line  
Any line will do, so long as it's thoughtful  
Don’t mix alignments in the same frame  
Don't use too many implied lines, clutters scenes  
Similarity:  
Matching styles = relation :O  
Can use dissimilarity for emphasis & grouping  
Repetition:  
Repeating visual elements strengthens a designs unity  
EMPHASIS:  
Contrast and Value:  
Using differences in Value to emphasize something  
range of colors involved is the tonal range  
Bigger range, bigger contrast, more interesting  
Eye is first attracted to high contrast, regardless of color  
Low-key: mostly dark tones or color levels  
Conveys a serious, somber, or reflective mood  
High-key: bright tones w/ few dark areas  
Mid-key: falls in between lol  
Color:  
Color contrast  
Warm, cool, neutral colors  
Warm colors are seen before cool colors  
Too much is overwhelming  
Cool colors cant really be overwhelming  
Neutrals don’t have hue  
A LOT OF GRAYS DO, BE CAREFUL  
Depth:  
What's in focus vs. what's in the background  
Shallow vs. Deep Depth of Field  
Proportion:  
Scale of objects relative to each other  
Size = importance
 
PERCEPTUAL FORCES:  
Balance:  
Visual weight of objects is effectively spread out  
Can be unstable on purpose for effect  
Different objects have different weights  
Large + dark > small + light  
Can be symmetrical OR asymmetrical  
Symmetrical Balance:  
Objects are weighted equally on opposing sides of the frame  
The normal seesaw analogy is called formal balance  
Perceived as tranquil, elegant, traditional, and conservative  
Predictable and less creative  
Asymmetrical Balance: informal balance  
Think if the see saw had an off-center fulcrum  
Much more interesting to design and compose  
More visually interesting and dynamic  
Rule of thirds lol  
Continuation:  
We process what we see continuing along lines that are predictable and free of obstacles and that don't abruptly change direction  
Graphic Vectors  
Strategically placing stationary line elements w/in the frame  
Real or implied  
Focus viewer's gaze in a specific direction or along a path  
Like leading lines  
Index Vectors  
Objects that conspicuously point in a specific direction.  
Crowd gazing upwards, large arrows, etc.  
Motion Vectors  
Real or apparent movement of objects  
All motion connotes directionality  
Motion blur/ trailing edge  
Figure-Ground  
What sticks out of the background, basically  
Just use contrast lol  
Psychological Closure  
We connect dots and fill in gaps lol  
Give enough visual clues and the brain does the rest for a complete mental impression
