An Introduction to Typography  
Type: a letterform used for communicating written info  
Typography: The art of designing and arranging type  
Typeface: particular style of type, like Times New Roman  
Font: a subsection of typeface in a particular style and size, like PostScript 12pt Times New Roman  
Font Family: related fonts
 
Modern Printing era starts with Gutenberg in 1450 w/ the printing press  
Metal type is still around, but typesetting is now largely digital
 
Legibility and Readability  
Legibility: the ease of identifying characters @ range  
Affected by things like x-height and counter size  
Readability: How easy it is to read text in context  
Affected by things like italics, font size, style, letter spacing, line spacing, alignment, background, capitalization choices, and contrast, (and legibility lol)
 
CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE TYPEFACES  
Traditions rooted in a time when letters were hand drawn
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Stroke|Vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or curved line  <br>Variable width|
|Contrast|Transition between thick and thin strokes|
|Stress|Location or angle of a contrast transition￼vertical v angled stress|
|Regular|No weight change|
|Boldface|Increase stroke width + visual weight  <br>Letterforms, serifs, and character spacing are adjusted￼ this is called counterform|
|Light|Opposite of Boldface|
|roman|Upright typefaces  <br>Different from Roman, which is a category of typeface|
|Oblique|Slant to the right by ~12 degrees  <br>Based on roman counterparts|
|Italic|Slant to the right by ~12 degrees￼based on handwritten counterparts|
|Baseline|The imaginary plane all characters rest on|
|Mean line|The imaginary plane all flat top lowercase letters touch at the top|
|X-height|Distance between mean line and baseline￼most easily measured with a lowercase x|
|Counter|Enclosed or partially enclosed open area in letters like O and G|
|Ascender|Any part of a lowercase character that extends above the x-height|
|Descender|Any part of a character below the baseline|
|Serif|Small marks on the ends of a main character stroke￼usually used in print|
|Sans Serif|Font without Serifs￼usually used in electronic media|

"typography applies the complex rules of design to the presentation of words on a printed page or digital screen to not only present written ideas but also set a tone or vibe, establish a visual hierarchy, and attract and maintain users’ interest. "

"Good type designs are usually invisible, meaning the reader’s attention is fixed on the words and the meaning of the text, rather than on the stylistic features of individual characters."

Weight

Posture

Proportions and letterform parts

Larger x-heights and counter sizes are usually easier to read

SERIF TYPEFACES  
6 main groups:  
Blackletter  
Humanist  
Old Style  
Transitional  
Modern  
Slab Serif
 
SANS SERIF TYPEFACES  
Humanist  
Geometric  
Transitional
 
DECORATIVE TYPEFACES  
Connote a sense of mood, emotion, or attitude  
Unusual features to add splash and pizzazz  
Use in moderation for the love of God
 
SCRIPT TYPEFACES  
Emulate cursive handwriting / calligraphy
 
DINGBAT TYPEFACE  
Symbol, Wing-ding, Webdings, Zapf Dingbats

"Serif typefaces are the industry standard for body copy that’s printed in books, magazines, and newspapers."

COMPUTERS AND TYPEFACES  
Most digital fonts are actually designed for printing  
Georgia + Verdana are the first computer-oriented fonts  
You can use JPEGs of bodies of text to avoid issues with people not having a font  
Limits Search Engine Optimization and requires alt text
 
Font Styles  
Most font families include 4 basic styles:  
roman (upright)  
Bold  
Italic  
Bold italic
 
True: Designer changed each glyph by hand  
Faux: Computer generated effects to change glyphs
 
Use italics and boldface for emphasis _sparingly_
 
CONDENSED V EXPANDED TYPE  
Condensed: tall and thin  
Expanded: short and fat
 
TALL CAPS v SMALL CAPS  
Tall caps: sets all text to uppercase so the tops touch the normal capline  
Small caps: all text to uppercase so the tops touch closer to the x-height
 
USE UPPERCASE SPARINGLY
 
Underline and Strikethrough  
Using them for emphasis is taboo in design lulw  
Any real use case is hyperlinks  
Ruins readability
 
FONT SIZE  
Font is measured in points  
10-12 is the standard for text to be printed  
Point size reflects the distance from the top of the tallest ascender to the bottom of the lowest descender, + some additional space on each end  
12 Points in a Pica  
6 Picas in an Inch  
72 Points in an Inch
 
72ppi is the standard bc?  
Think of font size as relative, not absolute
 
FONT COLOR  
Pick a color that contrasts from the background  
Dark type on light is easier to read than light type on dark  
Some color combos strain eyes, like red and green  
Colorblind people exist 4head
 
BASELINE SHIFT  
Shifting the baseline for individual characters
 
SUPERSCRIPT/SUBSCRIPT  
Smaller point size than surrounding text and shifted up/down the baseline
 
ANTI-ALIASING  
Jagged diagonals are called aliased  
Anti-aliasing is a transition from black to white to smooth out the jagged edges  
Don’t anti-alias text smaller than 10pt.
 
KERNING AND TRACKING  
Kerning: selectively varies the amount of space between 2 characters  
Tracking: uniformly adjusts letter spacing across a range of selected text  
Both can improve readability by removing useless white space  
Or make it worse lol  
LEADING  
Defines the amount of space between vertically adjacent lines of text  
They used to use physical strips of lead :O  
Measured in points as the distance from baseline to baseline
 
ALIGNMENT, JUSTIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION  
Alignment and justification refers to lining up objects/ text uniformly along their tops, bottoms, sides, or middles  
Distribution refers to inserting equal amounts of space between designated edges or centers of elements, placed along a vertical or horizontal edge
 
Left align text, leaving the right ragged for max readability
 
Don’t center justify too much, its bad for readability
 
FINAL TIPS:  
Limit # of typefaces  
Like, max 2  
Text first, type second  
Prioritize readability over style  
Less is More
 
You should take certain precautions when designing text for display on computer screens.
 
■ For body copy, its best to use a 10- to 14-point sans serif typeface that’s been specifically designed for use on digital displays, such as Verdana.
 
■ Do not use a script typeface or other typefaces with thinline strokes.
 
■ Constrain lengthy sections of text to shorter widths. When text flows across the entire width of the screen, it is difficult to read.
 
■ Apply anti-aliasing to large type to reduce the jagged edges of type.
 
■ While italics work well as a subtle method of emphasizing text in print, the slanted lines and curves lose detail when rendered out as square pixels. Use them sparingly, and experiment with adding color or bold to reduce the unwanted aliasing.
 
■ Remember the low-resolution limitations of computer monitors, and design type for maximum legibility and readability.
 
"To ensure font compatibility with other systems, select a font from one of the following families: Arial, Comic Sans, Courier New, Georgia, Impact, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Symbol, and Verdana. These are standard fonts that come with all Windows and Mac computer systems. They’re also considered to be web safe, meaning they are supported by all the most popular web browsers. "

"Applying a faux bold effect simply thickens the stroke of an existing roman form without changing a character’s style or spacing, producing a proportionally smaller amount of white space in counters and between each character, making text more difficult to read."

"As a general principle, avoid using caps to emphasize text, and also avoid mixing upper and lowercase letters together"

"Originally, point size referred to the vertical height of the metal block with the raised letterform."

"In Western countries, where people read from left to right and from top to bottom, readability is at its best when paragraphs are left justified and the type is evenly distributed"
