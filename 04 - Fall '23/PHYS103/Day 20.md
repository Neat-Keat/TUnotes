Xerographic Copiers
 
Observations

- Copiers consume colored powder or "toner"
- After jams, you can wipe off the powder images
- Copies are often warm after being made
- Copies are sometimes clingy with static electricity
 
3 questions

1. How can light arrange colored powder on paper?
    
    1. The light can control static electricity
      
    
    - Charge is sprayed onto insulating layer
    - Opposite charge flows onto layer's back
    - Layer acts as a charged capacitator
    - Light selectively erases charge
    - Remaining charge attracts toner particles
    - Toner particles are bonded to paper
      
    
      
    
2. How does a copies spray charge onto a surface?
    
    1. It uses a corona discharge to charge the air
      
    3. A fine wire having a large voltage is covered with tightly packed "like" charges
        
        - Repulsive forces are intense and push charges into air
        - The flow of charge intot he air is a corona discharge
          
        
    4. That discharge is caused by a strong electric field.
      
    
    Electric Field
    
    - Charge(1) pushes on Charge(2)
    - Charge(1) creates electric field that pushes charge(2)
      
    
    Voltage Gradient
    
    9. A + test charge accelerates along
        
        - Electric field
        - Path that reduces its total PE quickest
    10. Voltage is ESPE per charge
    11. A voltage gradient is an electric field
      
    
    Metals, Fields, and Corona Discharges
    
    14. Inside a metal, charge can move
        
        - At equilibrium: voltage is uniform, electric field is 0
        - Charge resides only on the metal's surface
    15. Outside a metal, charge cant move
    16. Near a thin wire or sharp point at large voltage:
        
        - Voltage varies rapidle with distance, so big electric field
        - Charge is pushed into the air: a corona discharge
          
        
      
    
3. How does a copier make its copies permanent?
    
    1. It fuses or melts the powder onto the paper  
In a xerographic copier or printer:
 
**The surface of a photoconductor has been coated with electric charge. This charge will remain in place until you expose the surface to**  
**A) light**
      

2 views of Electrostatic forces
    
**When a xerographic copier first applies electric charges to the surface of its photoconductor, it does so in the dark. The reason for applying these charges in the dark is that light exposure would:**  
**A) allow the charges to flow through the photoconductor so that they won't accumulate on its surface**
    
Summary

- It sprays charge from a corona discharge
- That charge precoats a special insulating surface

Flashlight
 
Voltage = Current * Resistance

- V = IR
 
Power = Voltage * Current  
Power = Resistance * Current^2
 
Open circuit = no current  
Close circuit = yes current  
Short circuit = no resistance, electricity moves at speed of light, causes fire
 
Observations

- They emit light when they're on
- Brighter flashlights often have more batteries
- Flashlights grow dimmer as their batteries age
- Sometimes hitting a flashlight brightens it
 
6 questions

1. Why does a flashlight need batteries and a bulb?
    
    1. Batteries power the bulb, which then emits light
      
    3. Batteries = chemical energy -> electrostatic energy
    4. Bulb = electrostatic energy -> light energy
    5. Think power
        
        - Power is energy/ unit of time
        - Measured in Watts
          
        
    
    A battery is a chemically powered pump for charge  
    Its pumps charge from – to +  
    It develops a voltage rise from – to +  
    It does work pushing charge to higher voltage  
    It turns chemical potential into electrostatic potential
    

Lightbulb Filament

3. Allows charges to flow thru it
    
    - Carries ccharge from its entry end to its exit end
    - Develops a voltage drop from entry end to exit end
    - Receives energy from charge flowing to lower voltage
    - Turns electrostatic potential into thermal energy
   

In a typical flashlight with 2 alkaline-cells  
Total voltage rise in the battery chain is 3.0 V  
Total electric power consumed by lightbult is 6 watts
   

1. How does power flow from batteries to bulb?
    
    1. Power is carried by a current of charge in wires
      
    3. Current measures the rate of charge motion
        
        - Electric charge crossing a boundary per unit of time
        - The SI unit of current: 1 ampere is 1 coulomb/second
    4. Batteries provide power to electric currents
    5. Bulbs consume power
      
    
    - Negative charges carry most currents
    
    - Negative charges flowing right
    - Positive charges flowing left
    
      
    
    **A) no current flows**
    
      
    
    - Pumped from low volt to high volt by batteries
    - Flows thru a wire to the bulb
    - Flows from high volt to low volt in lightbulb
    - Flows thru a wire to the batteries
    - Repeat
    
    - The current's job is to deliver power, not charge!
   

Current is defined as the flow of positive charge  
Its difficult to distinguish between
 
**In an open circuit:**
 
Current in the flashlight
 
- Metals are imperfect conductors
    
    - Electric currents can't coase thru them
    - Electric fields are needed to keep currents moving
- For a current to flow thru a metal
    
    - It must have an electric field in it caused by a voltage drop...
    - …
    - …
- How does a flashlight's switch turn it on or off?
    
    1. It opens or closes the circuit
      
    3. Steady current requires a "closed" circuit so charge loops and doesn’t accumulate anywhere - How can a battery be recharged?
    
    1. Push current thru it backward
      
    
    Effects of current direction
    
    4. Batteries typically establish the current direction
      

1. Why does a short-circuited flashlight get hot?
    
    1. Current bypasses the bulb and heats the wires
      
    3. If a conducting path bridges the filament
        
        - Current bypasses the filament -> circuit is "short"
        - There is no appropriate destination for the energy
        - Energy loss and heating occurs in the wires
    4. Short circuits can cause fires 3. How do lightbulbs differ?
    
    1. They have different electrical resistances
      
    3. Batteries determine the filament's voltage drop
    4. The smaller the resistance
        
        - The more current it carries
        - The more electric power it consumes
          
        
   

**In a short circuit:**  
**A) electrons can take a short cut**  
**(app its "no current flows"??)**
    
**Your cat has chewed the cord to your desk lamp and has created a short circuit – an electric connection from 1 wire to the other inside the cord. When you plug the lamp into the electric outlet,**  
**A) current will bypass the bulb and the bulb will not light up**
 
Summary

- Current carries power from batteries to bulb
- The switch controls the flashlight's circuit
- Current flows only when the circuit is closed
- The batterie
