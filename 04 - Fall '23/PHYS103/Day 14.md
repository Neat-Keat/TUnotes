Heat moves from hot to cold
 
Air conditioners
 
Observations
 
- They cool the air in a room
- They emit hot air from their outside vents
- They consume lots of electric power
- They are less efficient on hotter days
- Some can be reversed to that they heat room air
 
Questions

1. Why doesn’t heat flow naturally from cold to hot
    
    1. Such heat flow would violate the law of entropy
      
    
    1. Energy cant be created or destroyed
    2. The entropy of a thermally isolated system of objects never decreases. For a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases
    3. The entropy of a closed system at thermal equilibrium approaches a constant value.
    
    - Law of thermal equilibrium (zeroth law)
        
        - "if 2 objects are in thermal equilibrium with a 3rd object, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other"
    
      
      
     
**Suppose that you place a timer and a tiny pile of gunpowder in an absolutely rigid box. You then seal the box completely and insulate it perfectly so that no heat can flow in or out of the box. Soon the timer ignites the gunpowder and it burns to form smoke. Since the box is sealed, the smoke remains inside it. If you look into the box a few minutes later, you will find that the smoke has not converted back into the gunpowder because:**  
**Such an event, unburning the smoke to form gunpowder, is extraordinarily unlikely.**
 
Order vs Disorder

6. Converting ordered energy into thermal energy
    
    - Involves events that are likely to occur
    - Is easy to accomplish and often happens
7. Converting thermal energy into ordered energy
    
    - Involves events that are unlikely to occur
    - Is hard to accomplish and effectively never happens 
- The measure of a systems disorder
- Never decreases in an isolated system
- Can be rearranged within a system
- Can be transferred between systems
- Is NOT a conserved quantity (KNOW FOR EXAM)
 
Law of entropy  
"The entropy of a thermally isolated system never decreases"
 
- Part of the system can become colder as another part becomes hotter
- Entropy is exported from the cold part to the hot part
 
- 1 unit of thermal energy is more disordering to a cold object than to a hot object 
**Which of the following quantities is not conserved?**  
**Entropy**

**"The entropy of an isolated system never decreases." Which Law of Thermodynamics is this?**  
**Second**
 23. Why does an air conditioner need electricity?
    
    1. Electricity provides the necessary order
      
    
    - Moves heat from cold to hot
    - Would cause total entropy of world to decrease were it not for the electric power it consumes!
    
    It turns electric power into thermal power so the total entropy of world does not decrease
    
    - Air conditioners are heat pumps
        
        - Use work to transfer heat from cold to hot
    - Automobiles are heat engines
        
        - Use flow of heat from hot to cold to do work
    - Heat machines are governed by law of entropy
      
    
    - An AC uses a working fluid to
        
        - Absorb heat from cold
        - Release heat to hot
    - The evaporator
        
        - Transfers heat from cold to working fluid
    - The condenser
        
        - Transfers heat from working fluid to hot
    - The compressor
        
        - Does work on working fluid and produces entropy
        
24. How does an air conditioner cool room air?
    
    1. Its evaporator absorbs heat from the room air
      
    
25. What role does the electricity play?
    
    1. It powers the compressor and creates entropy
      
    
26. How does an AC heat outdoor air?
    
    1. Its condenser releases heat to the outdoor air 
**"Two objects in thermal equilibrium with a third object are in thermal equilibrium with each other." Which Law of Thermodynamics is this?**  
**Zeroth**
 
AC overview

31. Fluid evaporates in evaporator
32. Compressor raises pressure
33. Fluid condenses in condenser
34. Constriction lowers pressure
35. Repeat
 
4 laws of thermodynamics ( we only consider 3)
    
What is entropy?  
The measure of the disorder of a system. Also describes how much energy is NOT available to do work
   

Law of conservation of energy  
This law recognizes that heat is a form of energy  
"the change in the internal energy equals the heat in minus the work out"
   

Entropy
   

According to the law of entropy:
 
Natural Heat Flow
    
Unnatural heat flow  
When heat flows from cold object to hot object  
Law of entropy would be violated  
Unless we create additional entropy!

Summary

- They pump heat from cold to hot
- They don’t violate thermodynamics
- They convert ordered energy to thermal energy
