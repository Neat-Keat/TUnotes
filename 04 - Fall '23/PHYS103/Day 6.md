Bumper Cars
 
Energy is a conserved quantity  
So is momentum!
 
Observations about Bumper Cars

- Moving cars tend to stay moving
- Changing a car's motion takes time
- Impacts alter velocities and angular velocities
- Cars often appear to exchange their motions
- The fullest cars are the hardest to redirect
- The least-full cars get slammed during collisions
 
M(a)v(a)+sum(F)*delta(t) = m(b)v(b) + (m(a)+m(b))v
 
3 questions about Bumper Cars

1. Does a moving bumper car carry a force?
2. Does a spinning bumper car carry a torque?
3. How does a car accelerate on an uneven floor?

No, the bumper car carries momentum
 
Momentum is a conserved vector quantity.

- It cant be created/destroyed but can be transferred
- It combines bumper car's inertia and velocity 
Momentum = mass * velocity
    

Exchanging Momentum

- Bumper cars exchange momentum via impulses.
 
Impulse = force * time
 - When car 1 gives an impulse to car 2, car 2 gives an equal but oppositely directed impulse to car 1
    
    - The total momentum doesn’t change
    - The car with least mass changes velocity most to the littlest riders get creamed
      
    
   

No, the bumper car carries angular momentum
 
Angular momentum is a conserved vector quantity

- It cant be created or detroyed but can be transferred
- It combines bumper car's rotational inertia and velocity 
Angular momentum = rotational mass * angular velocity
 
Exchanging Angular momentum

- Bumper cars exchange angular momentum via angular impulses 
Angular impulse = torque * time
 - When car1 gives an angular impulse to car2, car2 gives an equal but oppositely directed angular impulse to car1
    
    - The total angular momentum doesn’t change
    - Car with least rotational mass changes angular velocity most so the littlest riders get spun wildly 
- Mass cant change, so the only way an object's velocity can change is if its momentum changes
- Rotational mass can change, so an object that changes shape can change its angular velocity without changing its angular momentum     
Rotational Mass can change
 
It reduces potential energy as quickly as possible
 
- Forces and potential energies are related!
    
    - A bumper car accelerates in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible
    - The bumper car accelerates opposite to the potential energy gradient
    - On an uneven floor, that is the steepest slope
 
CHAPTER 3
 
Spring Scales
 
Observations about Spring Scales

- They move downward during weighing
- They take a little time to settle
- They're only accurate when everything is at rest
 
4 Questions about Spring Scales

1. What exactly is a spring scale measuring?
2. How does a spring scale measure weight?
    
    1. It measures upward force needed for equilibrium

The weight of the object being weighed
 
The object has both a mass and a weight  
On the earth's surface, they are proportional  
Objects mass is the same everywhere  
Objects weight varies with gravity
 
Mass as a Measure

- An objects mass doesn’t depend on location
- Measuring an object's mass can be done directly
    
    - Exert a known force on the object
    - Measure the objects accel
    - Divide the force by the accel to find mass
- Measuring accel accurately is difficult
 
Weight as a measure

- An objects weight depends on location (gravity)
- Measuring an object's weight is done indirectly
    
    - The object's weight is a force that acts on the object
    - There is no direct way to measure that weight
- Fortunately, measuring weight indirectly is easy
- Spring scales measure weight, not mass    

- Spring scale measures weight using equilibrium
    
    - Exerts an upward force on the object
    - Adjusts that force until the object is in equilibrium
    - Measures the amount of that upward force
    - Reports that amount as the object's weight 
Using a Spring to Measure Weight

- Springs provide adjustable, measurable forces
- Recall that when an object is at equilibrium
    
    - Individual forces sum to zero – they cancel perfectly
    - Object is inertial – it remains motionless or it coasts
- A spring scale
    
    - Uses a spring to support the object
    - Allows the spring and object to reach equilibrium
    - Reports the spring's force as the object's weight
      
    
   

1. What is scale's dial or meter actually reporting?
    
    1. Its reporting how far the spring has distorted
 
A free spring adopts its equilibrium length  
When distorted, its ends experience forces that:

- Act to restore the spring to its equilibrium length
- Make the equilibrium length a stable equilibrium
- Are proportional to the distortion
 
Hooke's Law  
The restoring force on the end of a spring is equal to a spring constant times the distance the spring is distorted. That force is directed opposite the distortion
 
Restoring force = -spring constant * distortion
 
A Spring Scale

- To weigh an object with a spring scale,
    
    - Support the object with a spring
    - Let the object become motionless at equilibrium
    - Measure the distortion of the spring
- The spring constant relates distortion to force
- Once the spring constant is calibrated, reporting the spring's distortion is equivalent to reporting the restoring force that is supporting the object  
1. Why must you stand still on a spring scale?
    
    1. Scale is only accurate if you are in equilibrium
      
    3. If you are not in equilibrium,
        
        - The spring force is unrelated to your weight
    4. Since an accelerating object is not at equilibrium
        
        - You must not bounce on a scale!
        - You must wait for the scale to settle before reading 
- When you first load a scale, it bounces
    
    - It accels toward a new equilibrium
    - It then coasts thru that equilibrium
    - It then accels back toward the new equilibrium
    - It returns and overshoots many times
- It oscillates around its stable equilibrium
    
    - To settle at equilibrium, it must get rid of energy
    - Friction and air resistance help it settle
    

Oscillation
 
Summary about Spring Scales

- The spring stretches during weighing
- This stretch is proportional to objects weight
- The scale measures the spring's stretch
- The scale reports that stretch as object's weight
