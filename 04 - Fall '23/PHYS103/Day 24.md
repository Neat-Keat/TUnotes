Jeopardy  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**After running a plastic comb thru your hair several times you hold it above a small scrap of paper. The paper jumps off the table and sticks to the comb because the paper becomes**  
**A) electrically polarized**
 
**If you put an egg in a microwave oven, it will become very hot. But if you put a dehydrated egg in the microwave oven, the egg will not be affected because**  
**A) microwaves transfer heat to food principally through its water molecules**
 
**Thomas Edison's dominance in the electric power industry was struck by a serious blow when his competitors, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, began to use transformers with their AC electric power systems. Edison was unable to use transformers in his DC electric power systems because**  
**A) A transformer requires changing currents in its coils in order to transfer power between those currents**
 
**Why does a tidal cycle take more than 12 hours?**  
**A) The Moon orbits the Earth**
 
**A microwave oven is designed to use**  
**A) A fluctuating electric field to heat water**
 
**The strings of a guitar vibrate at different frequencies. They have different thicknesses because**  
**A) A thicker, more massive string vibrates at a lower frequency than a thinner frequency of the same length and tension**
 
**If an electron and a proton both experience the same electric force,**  
**A) the electron will have greater acceleration**
 
**Around high tension power lines there are**  
**A) both electric and magnetic fields**
 
**To read the magnetic strip on an ID or credit card, you must swipe it quickly past a tiny coil of wire. Why must the card be moving for the coil system to read it?**  
**A) A moving magnet will induce a current in the coil so that the magnetic strip can be read.**
 
**There is a metal screen on the front window of a microwave oven. This screen is essential because it**  
**A) reflects microwaves and keeps them inside the oven**
 
**You stick 2 pieces of adhesive tape on a glass window and then pull them off suddenly. If you now hold the tape pieces near each other, they will be**  
**A) repelled because they have like charges**
 
**Which has the stronger electric field between its two terminals: a 1.5V AA battery or a standard 9-V battery? Explain.**  
**A) a standard 9-v battery because it has a larger voltage gradient and therefore a stronger electric field**
 
**A harmonic oscillator is an oscillator**  
**A) with a restoring force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium**
 
**One way radio waves do not differ from visible light is that**  
**A) radio waves travel at the same speed as visible light**
 
**Electricity produced in a generating plant passes thru a large step up transformer. It produces the high voltages needed to send electric power long distances across the countryside. Which of the following is transferred from the transformer's primary coil to its secondary coil while the transformer is operating?**  
**A) Power alone.**
 
**Why would replacing the air inside a metal organ pipe with helium gas raise the pipe's pitch?**  
**A) helium is less dense than air, so it accelerates more rapidly than air.??**
 
**The north pole of a permanent magnet is clinging to the front surface of your steel refrigerator, so the refrigerator clearly has a south pole at its surface. If you flip the permanent magnet over, so that its south pole faces the refrigerator, the refrigerator will**  
**A) Place a north pole at its surface and attract the permanent magnet**
 
**Who originally named electric charges as positive and negative?**  
**A) Benjamin Franklin**
 
**What does the period of a pendulum depend on?**  
**A) length, and gravity**
 
**Why does FM radio sound richer than AM radio?**  
**A) FM has a larger bandwidth**
 
**Why are the tides relatively weak near the north and south poles?**  
**A) The moon's gravity produces two tidal bulges in the earth's oceans. Those tidal bulges peak near the equator, one on the side of the earth nearest the moon and one on the side of the earth farthest from the moon.**
 
**What type of circuit is used to tune a radio?**  
**A) tank circuit**
 
**You are working with a magnet and it breaks in half. You then end up with**  
**A) two magnets, each with a south and a north pole**
 
**You are a superb proposal writer and convince NASA to fund you taking a pendulum clock to Mars and studying how it runs. Compared to the time it should keep on Earth, the clock will run**  
**A) slower**
 
**A positive charge and a negative charge will**  
**A) attract each other**
