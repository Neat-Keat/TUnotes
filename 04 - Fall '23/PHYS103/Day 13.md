Observations

- Water has 3 phases
- Ice <32F
- Water >32F
- Steam >212F
- They can coexist
 
4 questions

1. How can water and ice coexist in a glass?
    
    1. At 32F, both phases are stable
    
    Ice and water can coexist at 32F exactly
    
 
**A popular classroom demonstration involves placing a paper cup with water in it on a burner, and boiling the water in the cup. Although part of the cup may burn, the part containing the water does not because**  
**The water absorbs most of the heat from the flame**
 
**Ice is crystalline**
 5. Can steam exist below 212F?
    
    1. Yes, but it's pressure is less than atmospheric
      
    
    Phase equilibrium
    
    - Molecules continually shift between the phases
    - 1 phase may grow at the expense of another phase
    - That growth often takes or releases thermal energy
    
    - 2 phases coexist indefinitely
    - Neither phase grows at the expense of the other
    
      
    
    Melt ice with heat and more pressure (this is atypical!)  
    Freeze water with cold and less pressure (this is atypical)
    
      
    
    Evaporate water with heat and less density  
    Condense steam with cold and more density
    
      
    
    Boiling:  
    Steam bubbles can form inside water  
    …  
    …

6. Where do ice cubes go in a frostless freezer?
    
    1. The ice sublimes directly into steam
      
    
    Ice and Steam
    
    4. To sublime ice, destabilize ice by
        
        - Adding heat
        - Lower density
    5. …
    
    Relative Humidity
    
    - At 100% relative humidity
        
        - Steam is in phase equilibrium with water and/or ice
    - Below 100% relative humidity
        
        - Water evaporates and/or ice sublimes
    - Above 100% relative humidity
        
        - Steam condenses as liquid water and/or deposits as ice
7. Is salt the only chemical that helps melt ice?
    
    1. No, any chemical that dissolves in water works
      
    
    Dissolved impurities stabilize liquid water  
    Shifts are proportional to solute particle density  
    Any soluble material can help ice to melt
    
      
    
    
When 2 phases are present:  
At phase equilibrium,
            

Below 0C, ice and steam are active phases  
Above 0, water and steam are active  
At 0, all 3 are active

Clothing, Insulation, and Climate
 
Observations:

- Clothing keeps you warm in cold places
- Clothing can keep you cool in very hot places
- Insulation controls heat flow in various objects
- Insulation can be obvious, as in foam cups
- Insulation can be subtle, as in special windows
- Greenhouse gases trap and warm the earth
 
4 questions

1. How does clothing control thermal conduction?
    
    1. Thermal conductivity
      
    
    Heat naturally flows from hot to cold  
    Limiting Thermal Conduction
    
    4. Clothing is often intended to reduce heat flow so it should use low-thermal conductivity materials:
        
        - Electrical insulators, not metals
        - Materials that trap air- air is a very poor thermal conductor
    
    It should use relatively thick materials  
    Reducing exposed area is helpful when possible
    
      
    
2. How does clothing control thermal convection?
    
    1. Natural Convection
      
    3. Heat naturally flows from hot to cold
    4. If 1 region of a fluid is hotter than the other
        
        - Those regions have diff densities
        - Buoyancy may cause the fluid to circulate
        - …
    5. Forced Convection
        
        - Buoyancy isnt always effective at moving fluids
        - Stirring the fluid enhances heat flow
    6. Limiting Thermal Convection
        
        - Clothing can reduce convective heat flow by...
        - The most effective clothing is thick and fluffy
        - A wind breaker minimizes forced convection
          
        
3. How does insulation control thermal radiation?
    
    1. Materials all emit thermal radiation because
    2. They contain electric charges
    3. Thermal energy causes those charges to accel
    4. Accelerating charges emit electromagnetic waves
    5. Hotter temps yield shorter wavelengths
    
    - Black body Spectrum
    
    Objects hotter than 500C glow visibly
    
      
    
    Radiative Heat Transfer
    
    - Your skin radiates heat at a rate given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law
    - …
    - …
      
    
    Limiting thermal Radiation
    
    - Insulation can reduce radiative heat flow by
        
        - …
    - Emissivity depends on temperatures
      
    - To reduce radiative heat flow...
      
    
4. Why do greenhouse gases warm the earth?
    
    1. By increasing altitude of Earth's radiating surface
      
    3. Earth receives thermal radiation from the sun
    4. Earth emits thermal radiation into space
    5. Balance requires Earth's radiating surface is –18 C
    6. Greenhouse gases increase altitude of that surface
 
If 1 end of a material is hotter than the other  
It will conduct heat from its hot end to its cold end
       
A surface's efficiency at absorbing and emitting thermal radiation is measured by its emissivity  
1 for perfect emitter-absorber (black)  
0 for non-emitter (white)
          
Effects of the Atmosphere

- Atmosphere has a temperature gradient
    
    - Air expands and cools as its altitude increases
    - Air temp decreases 6.6C per km
    - … 
Effects of Greenhouse Gases

- Greenhouse gases "darken" the atmosphere
- Increasing greenhouse gases cause global warming
- Limiting greenhouse gases is critical to our future
   

Summary

- Clothing and insulation limit heat transfer
- They use materials with low thermal conductivities
- They introduce drag to impede convection
- They use low emissivities to reduce radiation
- Greenhouse gases affect Earth's thermal radiation
- Those gases raise Earth's surface temperature
