Clocks CTD  
Harmonic Oscillators always have

- An inertial aspect
- A springlike restoring aspect

Period decreases as

- Inertial aspect becomes smaller
- Its spring-like restoring aspect becomes stiffer

Common harmonic oscillators include

- Mass on a spring, pendulum, flagpole, tuning fork
 
**A harmonic oscillator is an oscillator**

**A) with a restoring force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium**
 3. Why are some clocks particularly accurate?
    
    1. They take good care of their harmonic oscillators
      
    
    Period = 1 / frequency
    
      
    

Natural resonance: the energy in an isolated object or system of objects that causes it to perform a certain motion over and over again

5. How are harmonic oscillators used in clocks?
    
    1. Their motions are gently encouraged and counted
        
        - Supplies energy to keep the oscillator going
        - Counts each cycle and reports the time
        
        - Pendulums
        - Quartz
        - Balance rings
      
    
    - A pendulum is almost a harmonic oscillator
    
    - Restoring force is proportional to displacement
    - Period is independent of amplitude
    - Period is proportional to (length/gravity) ^ (½)
    
    - Is caused by gravity
    - Is proportional to the pendulums weight
    - …
    
    - Pendulum is the clock's timekeeper
    - For accuracy, pendulum's
        
        - Length is temperature stabilized
        - Length is adjusted for local gravity
        - Friction and air resistance are small
        - Motion is sustained gently
        - Motion is measured gently
    - The clock must not move or tilt 
Balance Ring Clocks

8. Coil spring and balance ring make harmonic oscillator
9. Balance ring twists back and forth rhythmically
    
    - Gravity exerts no torque
    - Gravity has no influence on period
 
Clocks have practical and fundamental limits to accuracy
   

A clock  
Common oscillators are
 
Pendulums  
For small displacements, pendulums:  
A pendulum's springlike restoring force  
…  
…
 
Pendulum Clocks
   

**You are a superb proposal writer and convince NASA to let you tag along to Mars with a pendulum clock in order to study gravity. Compared to how it would be on Earth, the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one cycle will be:**  
**A) longer**
 
Quartz oscillators

- A quartz crystal is a harmonic oscillator
- As a harmonic oscillator, a quartz crystal's
    
    - Oscillation decay is slow
    - Fundamental accuracy is high
- Quartz is piezoelectric
    
    - Mechanical and electrical charges are coupled
    - Motion can be induced and measured electrically

Quartz Clocks

- The quartz tuning fork in a quartz clock is
    
    - Kept vibrating thru electricity
    - Observed and its vibrations counted
    - Insensitive to gravity, temperature, pressure, and acceleration
- Slow oscillation decay = precise period
 
**___ supplies part of the energy to a pendulum clock, while ___ supplies most of the energy for a balance clock**  
**A) gravity, a spring**
 
Summary

1. Most involve harmonic oscillators
2. Amplitude independence aids accuracy
3. Clock sustains and counts oscillations
4. Oscillators that lose little energy work best

Observations about Musical Instruments

- They can produce different notes
- They must be tuned to produce the right notes
- They sound different, even on the same note
- They require energy to create sound
 
7 questions

1. Why does a taut string have a specific pitch?
    
    1. A taut string is a harmonic oscillator
        
        - Stable equilibrium shape
        - Mass that provides an inertial aspect
        - Tension and length to provide springlike restoring aspect
        
        - It vibrates about its equilibrium shape
        - Pitch is independent of its amplitude/volume
      
    
    Fundamental Vibration
    
    - A string vibrates up and down as a single arc
    - 1 displacement antinode at string's center
    - 2 displacement nodes, 1 at each end
      
    
2. Why does a vibrating string sound like a string?
    
    1. It has specific harmonics that define its sound
      
    
    A string can vibrate as
    
    4. 2 half strings
    5. 2 third-strings
    6. Etc
      
    
    Higher-order vibrational nodes
    
    9. Produce overtones
3. How does bowing cause a string to vibrate?
    
    1. Bowing adds a lttle energy to the string each cycle
    2. Plucking transfers energy all at once
    3. Bowing works over time
4. Why do stringed instruments need surfaces?
    
    1. Surfaces project sound much better than strings
      
    3. In air, sound consists of density fluctuations
    4. Vibrating strings don’t project sound well
    5. Surfaces project sound much better
      
      
    
5. What is vibrating in a wind instrument?
    
    1. Air in a tube is a harmonic oscillator
      
    
6. Why does a drum sound particularly different?
    
    1. Its overtones are not harmonies
7. How does sound travel thru air?
    
    1. Air exhibits longitudinal traveling waves 
Standing wave: nodes and antinodes don’t move  
Traveling wave: nodes and antinodes travel  
Open air is infinite, so it exhaibits traveling waves
 
A taut string has  
A taut string is a harmonic oscillator
 
Strings have 1!
      

Bowing or plucking a string excites a mix of fundamental and harmonic vibrations, giving it its sound
 
**The strings of a guitar vibrate at different frequencies. They have different thicknesses because**  
**A) a thicker, more massive string vibrates at a lower frequency than a thinner string of the same length and tension**
       
**If you blow across the top of a half full bottle of soda you can produce a clear tone. If you take a drink of soda to reduce the amount of liquid in the bottle and try this again the pitch (frequency) of the sound produced will**  
**A) decrease**
    
**Suppose you "think outside the box" and design a guitar with strings which all have the same thickness, length, and density. Which of the following designing issues must you also consider?**  
**A) The strings must be able to withstand a wide range of tensions in order to produce the notes needed.**
 
Summary

- They use strings, air, etc as harmonic oscillators
- Pitches are independent of amplitude/volume
- They are tuned by tension/pressure, length, density
- They often have harmonic overtones
- They project vibrations into the air as sound
