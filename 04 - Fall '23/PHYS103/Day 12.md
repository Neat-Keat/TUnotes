LIQUIDS  
Reynolds # < 2300 = laminar  
Reynolds # > 2300 = turbulent
 
GASSES  
Reynolds # < 100,000 = laminar  
Reynolds # > 100,000 = turbulent
 
Particles move from high to low pressure, along the **pressure gradient**

1. Why do some balls have dimples?
    
    1. To produce a turbulent boundary layer
    
    - Air effected by ball's surface is the boundary layer
    - Reynolds # <100,000: laminar boundary layer
        
        - Nearest sublayer is slowed relentlessly by viscous drag
    - Reynolds # >100,000: turbulent boundary layer
        
        - Sublayers tumble and interchange; they help each other.
        - Boundary layer penetrates deeper into rising pressure. 
Turbulent Flow around fast ball

4. Air flowing near ball's surface
    
    - Stalls beyond ball's sides
    - Peels main air flow off of ball
5. Boundary layer is turbulent
    
    - Retains total energy further
    - Resists peeling better
6. Small wake forms behind ball
7. Ball experiences a small pressure drag force
    
Tripping the boundary layer

- To reduce pressure drag, some balls have dimples
    
    - Dimples trip the boundary layer
    - Cause boundary layer to become turbulent
    - Turbulent boundary layer resists peeling better
    - Ball's main airflow forms smaller turbulent value
- Ex: golf ball
 
1. Why do spinning balls curve in flight?
    
    1. They experience 2 aerodynamic lift forces
        
        - Turning surface pushes/pulls on the air flow
        - Air on 1 side makes longer bend toward the ball
        
        - Turning surface alters point of flow separation
        - Flow separation and wake are asymmetric
      
    

Laminar effect: Magnus force  
Turbulent effect: Wake deflection force
 
Summary abt balls and air

- Balls in air exp aero forces
- Downstream forces are drag forces
- Sideways pressure forces are lift forces
- Moving particles exp viscous drag forces
- Moving balls exp pressure drag forces
- Spinning balls exp magnus and wake deflection lift forces

AIRPLANES  
￼Observations

- They use the air to support themselves
- They need airspeed to stay aloft
- They seem to follow their nose, up or down
- They can rise only so quickly
- Their wings often change shape in flight
- They have various propulsion systems
 
QUESTIONS:

1. How does an airplane support itself in the air?
    
    1. It deflects air downward, air pushes it upward
    2. Air bends away from wing bottom,
        
        - Air pressure rises, speed drops
    3. Air bends toward wing top
        
        - Air pressure drops, speed rises
2. How does the airplane lift off the runway?
    
    1. The airplane sheds a vortex and is lifted upward
    
    As wing stars moving in air  
    …  
    **You are holding 2 identical looking balloons, 1 filled with water and one filled with air. Dropping them at the same time, the water-filled one hit the ground first. Which experienced the larger amount of drag?** The water filled balloon because it moved faster
    
3. Why does a plane tilt up to rise, down to descend?
    
    1. The wing's angle of attack affects its lift
    2. A wing's lift depends on
        
        - The shape of its airfoil
        - Its angle of attack – its tilt …
    
    - At too great an angle of attack,
        
        - The upper boundary layer stalls
        - The airstream detaches from wing
        - The lift decreases dramatically
        - Severe pressure drag appears
    - The plane plummets abruptly
4. Why are there different wing shapes?
    
    1. Airspeed and performance influence wing design
    2. Asymmetric airfoils produce large lifts
    3. Symmetric airfoils produce small lifts
    4. Some planes change wing shape in flight
5. How does a plane turn?
    
    1. It uses lift to accelerate in the direction of turn
    2. Airplane has 3 orientation controls:
        
        - Its angle of attack is controlled by elevators
        - Its tilt is controlled by ailerons
        - Its rotation is controlled by rudder
    3. Steering involves ailerons and rudder
    4. Elevation involves elevators and engine
6. How does a plane propel itself thru the air?
    
    1. It pushes air backward with its props or engines
    2. Propellers are spinning wings
        
        - They deflect air backward
        - Do work on air
        - Pump air toward rear of plane
    3. …

Limits to lift: stalling
 
**Suppose you are a teacher and, to your excitement, the local weather person comes for a classroom visit! She is talking about tornadoes and says that there is air moving very rapidly upwards thru the funnel and air moving at the same speed outside the funnel. Such motion would cause: the funnel pressure to be equal to the pressure outside**
 
Summary

- Airplanes use lift to support themselves
- Propulsion overcomes induced drag
- Speed and angle of attack affect altitude
- Extreme angle of attack causes stalling
- Propellers do work on passing airstream
- Jet engines do work on slowed airstream
