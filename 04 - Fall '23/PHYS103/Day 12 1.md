They're called convection ovens because the heat is even everywhere in the oven

7.1 Woodstoves
 
Observations about Woodstoves

- They burn wood in enclosed fireboxes
- They often have long chimney pipes
- Their surfaces are usually dark-coated
- They'll burn you if you touch them
- Heat rises off their surfaces
- They warm you when you stand neat them
 
5 questions

1. What are thermal energy and heat?
    
    1. Disordered energy and its transfer mechanism
      
    
    - Disordered energy within an objects particles
    - The kinetic and potential energies of those particles
    
    - Due to a difference in their temps
    
      
    
    **You are a mechanic in a garage and are working on a carburetor that is made of metal, has a glass inspection window and plastic gears for the choke. If all 3 types of material are at the same temp and each material is in touch with the other 2, then:**  
    **No heat will flow between any parts.**
    
      
      
      
    
2. How does a woodstove produce thermal energy?
    
    1. It converts chemical energy into thermal energy
3. Why does heat flow from the stove to the room?
    
    1. Because the stove is hotter than the room
      
    
    - Microscopically, thermal energy moves both ways
    - Statistically, the net flow is from hotter to colder
    
    - No heat flows between those objects
    
    Temperature measures the average thermal KE per particle
    
      
    
4. Why is a woodstove better than an open fire?
    
    1. It releases heat, but not smoke, into the room
      
    3. An open fire is energy efficient but has problems
        
        - Smoke is released into the room
        - Fire uses up the rooms oxygen
        - Open fire can set fire to the room
    4. A fireplace is cleaner, safer, but less efficient
      
    
    **A common glass thermometer contains a red or silver liquid that rises upward in a glass tube as the temperature of the thermometer increases. The liquid moves up the tube because**  
    **While both the glass and the liquid expand as their temperatures increase, the liquid expands more rapidly than the glass does**
    
      
    
    Heat exchanges
    
    9. A woodstove is a heat exchanger
        
        - It separates air used by the fire from room air
        - It transfers heat without transferring smoke
          
        
5. How does a woodstove heat the room?
    
    1. It uses all three heat transfer mechanisms
 
Thermal energy is  
Heat is energy flowing between objects
       
Fire releases chemical potential energy

- Wood and air consists of molecules
- Molecules are bound by chemical bonds
- When bonds rearrange, they can release energy
- Burning rearranges bonds and releases energy
 
Chemical Forces and Bonds

- Atoms interact via electromagnetic forces
- The chemical forces between 2 atoms are:
- Attractive at a distance
- Repulsive up close
- 0 at equilibrium

Atoms at their equilibrium separation

- Are in a stable equilibrium
- Are bound together by an energy deficit

Their energy deficit is a chemical bond
 
**Why does the handle of a metal spoon submerged in boiling soup feel hot?**  
**Heat from the soup is transferred thru the spoon by conduction**
 
A few names

- Molecule: atoms joined by chemical bonds
- Chemical bond: a chemical-force linkage
- Bond strength: the work needed to break bond
- Reactants: stating molecules
- Products: ending molecules
 
Chemical Reactions

- Breaking old bonds takes work
- Forming new bonds does work
- If new bonds are stronger than the old bonds,

…
  
When wood burns

- The reactants are carbohydrates and oxygen
- The products are water and co2

...
   

Heat naturally flows from hotter to colder  
At thermal equilibrium
         

- Those heat transfer mechanisms are:
    
    - Conduction: heat flows thru materials
    - Convection: heat flows via moving fluids
    - Radiation: heat flows via electromagnetic waves
 
In conduction, heat flows, but atoms stay put  
In an insulator:  
,….  
In convection, heat flows with a fluid's atoms  
Buoyancy drives natural convection  
Convection circulates hot air around the room
 
In radiation, heat flows via electromagnetic waves  
Range of waves depends on temp  
Cold: radio, micro, IR  
Hot: IR, visible, UV
 
Higher temp -> more radiated heat  
Blacker surface -> more radiated heat  
Black emits and absorbs radiation perfectly
 
Stefan-Boltzmann Law  
Power = emissivity * SB constant * temp^4 * surface area
 
What about campfires?

- No conduction, unless you touch hot coals
- No convection, unless you're above fire
- Lots of radiation
    
    - Front is hot bc radiation hits it
    - Back is cold bc of the opposite
 
Summary

- Use all 3 heat transfer mechanisms
- Have tall chimneys for heat exchange
- Are dark-coated to encourage radiation
- Are sealed to keep smoke out of room air

7.2 Water, Steam, and Ice
 
Observations

- Water has 3 phases
- Ice <32F
- Water >32F
- Steam >212F
- They can coexist
 
4 questions

1. How can water and ice coexist in a glass?
    
    1. At 32F, both phases are stable
    
    Ice and water can coexist at 32F exactly
    
 
**A popular classroom demonstration involves placing a paper cup with water in it on a burner, and boiling the water in the cup. Although part of the cup may burn, the part containing the water does not because**  
**The water absorbs most of the heat from the flame**
 3. Can steam exist below 212F?
    
    1.   
        
4. Where do ice cubes go in a frostless freezer?
5. Is salt the only chemical that helps melt ice?
