Density Rho = mass / Volume  
￼Pressure P = Force / Area = lb / in^2
 
Water motion in a pipe:

- Laminar flow
- Turbulent flow
 
Garden Watering
 
Observations:

- Faucets let you control water flow
- Faucets can make noise when open
- Longer, thinner hoses deliver less water
- Water sprays at high speed from a nozzle
- Water only sprays so high
- A jet of water can push things over
 
6 Questions:

1. How does a faucet control flow?
    
    1. Water's energy and viscosity limit the flow
    2. Water traverses a narrow passage in the faucet
    3. Total energy limits flow speed thru passage.
        
        - The water turns its total energy into kinetic energy, but its peak speed is limited by is initial pressure.
    4. Motion near surfaces slows water in the passage
        
        - Because water at the passage walls is stationary, viscous forces within the water slow all of it.
          
        
    
    Viscous Forces and Viscosity
    
    6. Viscous forces
        
        - Oppose relative motion within a fluid
        - Are similar to sliding friction: they waste energy
    7. Fluids are characterized by their viscosities
      
    
2. How much does the diameter of a hose matter?
    
    1. It matters a surprisingly large amount
    2. Water flow thru a hose is proportional to
      
    
    Flow rate = (pi * pressure difference * hose diameter^4) / (128 * hose length * viscosity)
    
      
    
    **Fast** **moving** **water** **makes** **noise** **bc** **of** **turbulence**
    
      
    
3. Why does water pour greatly from an open hose?
    
    1. The free-flowing water wastes most of its energy
    
    …  
    ...
    
4. Why does water spray fast from a nozzle?
    
    1. The nozzle causes water to turn PPE into KE
    2. As water flow necks down in a nozzle, it must:
        
        - Speed up
        - Have a pressure imbalance pushing it forward
        - Flow from hi to low pressure
      
    4. Making water accel
        
        - Even in steady-state, water can accel
            
            - Forward accel leaves gaps
            - Backward accel causes jams
            - So the accel must involve turning
        - Acceleration towards the side
            
            - …
            - …
    5. Bending the flow in a Hose
        
        - Requires a pressure imbalance
    6. Flow in bent hose develops a pressure gradient
    7. Water accels from high pressure to low pressure 6. Speeding the flow in a nozzle
    
    - Speeding the flow requires a pressure imbalance
7. Flow in nozzle develops a pressure gradient
8. What causes hissing in a faucet, hose, or nozzle?
    
    1. Water can become turbulent and produce noise
    2. We have been examining laminar flow
    3. Now well look at turbulent flow, which produces thermal energy 
**Flowing honey is less likely to become turbulent than flowing water because: honey's large viscosity favors laminar flow**
 
Reynolds Number

13. The flow type depends on the Reynolds number 
Reynolds number = inertial influences / viscous influences  
= (density * obstacle length * speed) / viscosity
 17. Below ~2300 viscosity wins, so flow is laminar
18. Above ~2300 inertia wins, so flow is turbulent 20. Why do pipes rattle when you close the faucet?
    
    1. Moving water carries momentum
                      
- Water transfers its momentum via impulses:
    
    - Impulse = pressure * surface area * time
- Large momentum transfers require:
    
    - Large pressures, large surface areas, or long times
- Moving water can be surprisingly hard to stop
    
    - Sudden stops can result in enormous pressures
   

**As the Reynolds number increases: flow is going from being viscous dominated to inertia dominated and therefore turbulent**

Balls and Air
 
Observations about Balls and Air

- Air resistance slows a ball down
- The faster a ball moves, the quicker it slows
- Some balls have textured surfaces to affect the air
- Spinning balls curve in flight
 
4 questions:

1. Why do balls experience air resistance?
    
    1. Balls interact with and transfer momentum to air
      
    3. When a ball moves thru the air, drag forces arise
    4. When a ball deflects passing air, lift forces arise
      
    
    - Surface friction causes viscous drag
    - Turbulence causes pressure drag
    - Deflected flow causes lift
    - Deflected flow also leads to induced drag 3. How does air flow around a ball?
    
    1. That depends on Reynolds number(100,000)
      
    3. At low Reynolds number, the flow is laminar (below 100,000)
    4. At high reynolds number, the flow is turbulent (above 100,000)
   

Types of aerodynamic forces
 
**Tennis ball A is dry and fuzzy. Tennis ball B is wet, and the fuzz is matted down. What will happen when the 2 balls are hit horizontally so as to have the same initial horizontal velocity?**  
**A goes farther than B because the fuzz reduces drag**
      

Laminar Flow around a Ball

- Air bends away from ball's front
- Air bends towards ball's side
- …
 
**On a windy day you notice that a tall light pole is bent away from its equilibrium position. If the wind speed were to increase the pole would: Bend further from its equilibrium position because the aerodynamic drag forces that are bending the pole will increase with the speed of the air moving around the pole.**
