**Falling Balls**
 
Observations about falling balls  
When you drop a ball, it:

- Begins at rest, but acquires downward speed
- Covers more and more distance each second

When you toss a ball straight up, it:

- Rises to a certain height
- Comes momentarily to a stop
- And then descends, much like a dropped ball

A thrown ball travels in an arc
 
5 questions about falling balls

- Why do dropped balls fall down?
    
    - Earths gravity exerts a force on the ball
        
        - That force is the balls weight
        - That weight points toward Earth's center
        - Its weight causes the falling ball to accelerate downward, toward Earth's center - Do different balls fall at different rates?
    
    - No, they all fall together
        
        - A balls weight is proportional to its mass
            
            - Weight/mass = 9.8(N/kg)
        - That ratio is equivalent to an acceleration
            
            - Weight/ mass = force / mass = acceleration
- Would a ball fall differently on the moon?
    
    - Yes!
        
        - A(earth) = 9.8m/s^2
        - A(moon) = 1.6m/s^2
- Can a ball move upward and still be falling?
    
    - Yes!
- Does a balls horizontal motion affect its fall?
    
    - No. Ball falls vertically but coasts horizontally.
        
        - Balls accel is purely vertical (downward
        - It falls vertically
        - It coasts horizontally
   

Summary about falling balls

- Without gravity, an isolated ball would coast
- With gravity, an isolated ball:
    
    - Experiences its weight
    - Accelerated downward
    - And its velocity becomes increasingly downward
- Whether going up or down, its still falling
- It can coast horizontally while falling vertically
 
Observations about ramps

- Its difficult to lift a heavy cart straight up
- Its easier to push a heavy cart up a ramp
- That ease depends on the ramp's steepness
- Shallow ramps need gentler but longer pushes
-   
    
 
4 questions about ramps

- Why doesn’t a cart fall through a sidewalk
    
    - The sidewalk pushes up on it and supports it
        
        - Sidewalk and cart cannot occupy the same space
        - Sidewalk exerts a support force on cart that:
            
            - Prevents cart from penetrating sidewalk's surface
            - Acts perpendicular to sidewalk's surface -> upward
            - Balances cart's downward weight
- Why does the sidewalk exactly support the cart
    
    - The sidewalk and cart negotiate
        
        - The cart and sidewalk dent one another slightly
            
            - The more they dent, the harder they push apart
            - Cart accelerates up or down in response to net force
            - Cart bounces up and down during this negotiation
        - Cart comes to rest at equilibrium – zero net force
 
- If the cart and sidewalk dent each other too much:
    
    - Each one pushes the other away strongly
    - They accelerate away from one another
- If the cart and sidewalk dent one another too little:
    
    - Each one pushes the other away weakly ( or not at all)
    - They accelerate toward one another
      
    
 
Newton's Third Law  
For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on the first object.
 
MISCONCEPTION ALERT  
The forces 2 objects exert on one another must be equal and opposite, but each force of that pair is exerted on a different object, so those forces do not cancel one another.
 
- Why is it easy to push the cart up the ramp?
    
    - The ramp supports most of the cart's weight
 
- Pushing the cart up the ramp
    
    - To start the cart moving uphill:
        
        - Push cart uphill more than the downhill ramp force
        - Net force is uphill so cart accelerates uphill

- What physical quantity is independent of path?
    
    - The work you do lifting the cart a certain height
        
        - Work = force * distance
 
Energy and work

- Energy – a conserved quantity
    
    - Cant be created or destroyed
    - Can be transformed or transferred between objects
    - It is the capacity to do work
- Work – mechanical means of transferring energy
 
Transfers of energy  
Energy has 2 principal forms:

- Kinetic energy – energy of motion
- Potential energy – energy stored in forces

Your work transfers energy from you to the cart

- Your chemical potential energy decreases
- Carts gravitational potential energy increases
 
Mechanical Advantage

- Mechanical advantage is doing the same work, using a different balance of force and distance
- A ramp provides mechanical advantage
    
    - Push weaker for longer
    - Your work is independent of the ramps steepness
