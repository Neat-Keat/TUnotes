Balloons
 
The term fluid includes both liquid and gases, the main difference is the volume of a liquid remains definite; it takes the shape of the surface its in contact with, unlike a gas
 
Density of matter  
Gas is loosely packed  
Liquid is packed  
Solid is tightly packed
 
**Density = mass / volume**
 
Observations about Balloons

- Balloons are held taut by the gases inside
- Some balloons float in air while others don’t
- Hot air balloons don’t have to be sealed
- Helium balloons leak even when sealed
 
Questions:

1. How does air inflate a rubber balloon?
    
    1. Its pressure pushes the balloon's skin outward
2. Why doesn’t the atmosphere fall or collapse?
    
    1. A gradient in its pressure supports its weight
        
        - Air has a density: it has mass per volume
        - Air's pressure is proportional to its density
        - Airs density gives it a weight per volume
        - The atmosphere is in equilibrium
      
      
    
3. Why does the atmosphere push up on a balloon?
    
    1. Its pressure gradient pushes the balloon upward
      
    
4. Why does a hot-air balloon float in cold air?
    
    1. It weighs less than the air it displaces
        
        - Contains fewer particles than the air it displaces
        - Weighs less than the air it displaces
        - Experiences a buoyant force that exceeds its weight\
      
    
    - Airs temp on aconvential scale is
        
        - Related to avg thermal kinetic energy per particle
        - …..
          
        
    
5. Why does a helium balloon float in air?
    
    1. It weighs less than the air it displaces
    2. Compared w/ the air, the particles in helium gas
        
        - Are lighter but move faster and bounce more often
        - Contribute just as much to pressure
    3. A balloon filled with helium at ordinary pressure
        
        - Contains as many particles as the air it displaces
        - Weighs less than the air it displaces
        - Weighs less than the air it displaces
        - Experiences a buoyant force that exceeds its weight
 
Air is a gas: individual atoms and molecules  
Air has pressure: it exerts a force on a surface  
Pressure inside a balloon is greater than outside  
Total pressure forces on balloon skin are outward  
Balloon is held taut by those outward pressure forces
 
**Pressure = pounds / in^2 = Force / Area**
 
Air consists of individual atoms and molecules  
Thermal energy keeps them separate and in motion  
Air particles bounce around in free fall, like tiny balls  
Air particles transfer momentum as they bounce  
Each momentum transfer involves tiny forces  
A surface exposed to air experiences a force  
The force on a surface is proportional to its area  
The force per area is the air's pressure
 
Balanced pressures exert no overall force  
Pressure forces on 2 sides of a surface are balanced  
Overall pressure force on that surface is 0  
Unbalanced pressures exert an overall force
    
Squeezing air particles more closely together  
Increases the air's density  
Increases the air's pressure  
Increases the air's weight per volume
 
The atmosphere  
Supporting its weight structures the atmosphere  
A pressure imbalance suppors each layer's weight  
Air pressure decreases with altitude: a pressure gradient  
…
   

Air pressure is:  
Stronger at the bottom, weaker at the top  
Push balloon up  
As the temp of air increases, its particles:  
Move faster, bounce harder, and bounce more often  
Contribute more to air's pressure  
A balloon filled with hot air at ordinary pressure
 
An aside abt temperature
   

Pressure and Particle Density  
Particle density: particles per volume  
…
 
The Ideal Gas Law  
Pressure = Boltzmann constant * particle density * absolute temperature
   

Summary about Balloons

- A balloon will float if its avg density is less than that of the surrounding air
- A hot air balloon has a lower particle density and a lower density than the surrounding air
- A helium balloon has the same particle density but a lower density than the surrounding air
   

Water Distribution
 
Observations:

- Water is pressurized in pipes
- Higher pressures spray harder
- Higher pressures spray higher
- Watern stored in tall water towers
   

4 Questions

1. Why does water move thru level pipes?
    
    1. It accelerates toward lower pressure
        
        - When water experiences 0 net force, it coasts
        - When water experiences a net force, it accelerates
        - Pressure imbalances exert net forces on water
        - Water accelerates toward lower pressure
2. How can you produce pressurized water?
    
    1. Push inward on the water, using a surface
    
    To pressurize water, confine it and squeeze. As you push inward: it pushes outward on you  
    Warter's outward push is produced by its pressure, so the water's pressure rises as you squeeze it harder
    
    3. Water, a liquid, is incompressible
        
        - Its volume remains constant as its pressure increases

Water, like all fluids, obeys Newton's laws
 
To deliver pressurized water to a pipe:

- Squeeze water to in...
 
Pumping requires work

- You do work as you pump water into the pipe
    
    - You squeeze the water inward – the force
    - The water moves inward – the distance
    - The work you do pumping water is
        
        - Work = pressure * volume
    
    …
    
 
1. Where does the work you do pumping water go?
    
    1. To the water at the delivery-end of the pipe
        
        1. PPE is unusual because
            
            1. Its not really stored in the pressurized water
            2. Its promised by the water's pressure source
        2. In steady state flow (SSF)…
          
        
2. As water flows, what happens to its energy?
    
    1. That energy is converted between several forms
      
    3. In SSF, water flows along streamlines
    4. Water flowing along a single streamine in SSF

Gravity causes pressure gradients

- Like air in the atmosphere, water in a pipe
    
    - Has a density and a weight per volume
    - Has a pressure gradient when it is at equilibrium
    - Has its pressure decrease with altitude
    - Has its weight supported by that pressure gradient
- Water has Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)
    
    - This increases with altitude
 
As water flows upward in a uniform pipe,

- Its speed cant change
- Its GPE...
- …
 
…  
....
 
Summary

- Water's energy remains constant dufing SSF
- Water's energy changes form as it:
    
    - Flows up or
    - Rises / falls in open sprays
    - Shoots out of nozzles or collides with objects
- Water distribution can be driven by
    
    - Pressurized water
    - Elevated water
    - Fast-moving water

The buoyant force between 2 objects of the same mass but different densities is the same
 
Cappuccino bubbles stay at the top bc they are less dense than the coffee but more dense than the air
 
Pressure potential energy has to do with describing moving water and is only an abstract concept
