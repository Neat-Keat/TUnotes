Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. It also describes how much energy is NOT available to do work
 
Observations

- They burn gas to obtain their power
- They are rated in horsepower and by volume
- Their engines contain "cylinders"
- They have electrical systems
- They are propelled by their wheels
 
Questions

1. How can an automobile run on thermal energy?
    
    1. An automobile engine is a heat engine
      
    
    - Allows heat to flow from hot to cold
    - Would cause total entropy of world to increase if it didn’t produce mechanical power
      
    
2. How efficient can an automobile engine be?
    
    1. Its efficiency is limited by the law of entropy
      
    
    **A diesel engine is more efficient than a gasoline engine because**  
    **It has a higher temperature and can therefore convert more heat into work**
    
      
    
3. How is an automobile engine a heat engine?
    
    1. Heat flows from hot to cold
      
    
    - Burns a fuel-air mixture in an enclosed space to produce hot
    
    - Engine converts some heat into useful work
    - The automobile uses that work to propel itself
    
      
    
    4 stroke engine **(MEMORIZE ME)**
    
    7. Induction stroke: fill cylinder with fuel and air
        
        - Intake valve opens
        - Engine pulls piston out of cylinder
            
            - Engine does work on piston
            - Low pressure produced inside cylinder
        - Fuel-air mixture flows into cylinder
        - Intake valve closes
    8. Compression stroke: squeeze mixture
        
        - Engine pushes piston into cylinder
            
            - Engine does work on piston
        - Mixture is compressed
            
            - Mixture pressure increases
            - Mixture temp increases
            - Work becomes heat
    9. Power stroke: burn and extract work
        
        - Spark plug ignites the fuel-air mix
        - Hot gas pushes piston out of cylinder
            
            - Piston does work on engine
        - Burned gas expands
            
            - Gas pressure and temp decreases
        - Heat becomes work
    10. Exhaust stroke: empty cylinder of exhaust
        
        - Exhaust valve opens
        - Engine pushes piston into cylinder
            
            - Engine does work on piston
            - High pressure is produced inside cylinder
        - Burned gas flows out of cylinder
        - Exhaust valve closes
      
    
    Efficiency Limits
    
    13. Overall, an internal combustion engine
        
        - Produces more work than it consumes
        - Converts some heat into work
    14. Law of entropy limits heat becoming work
        
        - Some heat must be releases into outside air
        - Eff increases with temp difference
        - Real engines never reach ideal efficiency
      
    
    **The ___ the temperature difference between hot and cold, the ___ the fraction of heat you can divert and transform into ____**  
    **Larger, larger, work**
     5. Why do cars sometimes "knock"
    
    1. Compressing a flammable gas can ignite it
      
    3. During the compression stroke, fuel-air mix
        
        - Becomes extremely hot
        - Can ignite spontaneously
    
    …
    
6. How is a diesel Engine different?
    
    1. It uses compression heating to ignite fuel
      
    
    - Compresses air to v high pressure & temp
    - Injects fuel between compression and power strokes
    - Lets fuel ignite upon entry into the superheated air
    
    …
    
7. Why does the engine have a catalytic converter?
    
    1. To remove unwanted components from exhaust
      
    3. Imperfect fuel-air mixtures produce pollutants that are:
        
        - Too rich: carbon monoxide and fuel in exhaust
        - Too lean: nitrogen oxides in exhaust
        - Imperfect diesel: carbonized particulates in exhaust
    4. Catalytic converter destroys unwanted molecules
    5. Filter removes and burns unwanted particulates 
- Reduce pollutant molecules
    
    - Plat helps oxidize carbon monoxide and fuel
    - Rhodium helps remove nitrogen oxides
- Using tiny, high-surface area catalyst particles
    
    - Increase the fraction of atoms available for reactions
    - Decreases the amount of precious metals required  
Summary

12. Heat flows from hot to cold
13. Some of that heat is converted to work
14. Energy efficiency is limited by thermodynamics
15. Higher temperatures increase efficiency
 
An automobile
   

A heat engine  
Cant decrease the worlds overall entropy  
As that temp difference increases  
Heat flowing from hot to cold creates more entropy so more heat can be converted to work
   

A heat pump  
Cant decrease the world's overall entropy, and its efficiency depends on the temp difference  
As that temp diff increases  
Heat pumped from cold to hot destroys more entropy so more work must be converted to heat
   

An internal combustion engine  
As heat flows from hot to cold
         

Diesel engine
