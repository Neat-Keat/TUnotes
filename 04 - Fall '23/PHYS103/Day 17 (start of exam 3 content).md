Chapter 9 – Resonance and Mechanical Waves

- Section 9.1 - Clocks
 
Observations about clocks

- They divide time into uniform intervals
- They measure time by counting those intervals
- Some clocks use motion to mark their intervals
- Other clocks don’t appear to use motion
- They require energy to operate
- They have good but not perfect accuracy
 
5 Questions:

1. Why don’t any modern clocks use hourglasses?
    
    1. Hourglasses are best as timers, not clocks
    
    They measure intervals fairly accurately  
    They are well suited to subdividing the day
    
      
    
    The repetitive motion sets accuracy
    
    - Temp, air pressure, or time of day
    - The clock's store of energy
    - The mechanism that measures the oscillation
    
2. Are all repetitive motions equally accurate?
    
    1. Insensitivity to the amplitude of motion helps
 
They are poorly suited to subdividing the day  
They require frequent intervention
 
Devices that tick off time intervals repetitively began appearing ~500 years ago  
Pendulums  
Torsion balances  
Tuning forks
 
Any device with a stable equilibrium  
Can move repetitively about that equilibrium as long as it has excess energy  
It must not depend on externals, like
