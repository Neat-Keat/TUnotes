5 questions

1. Why are there tides?
    
    1. The moons gravity causes the oceans to bulge
        
        1. Moons gravity acts nonuniformly on the earth
            
            1. Tida distortion of the oceans produces 2 bulges
            2. Locations of tidal bulges change as the earth rotates
        2. High and low tides occur almost 2x a day
      
    
    Strongest tides are when the moon and sun pull the same way and vice versa
    
      
    
2. How do giant tides develop?
    
    1. Sympathetic vibration in channels
      
    
    It’s a harmonic oscillator  
    Its period is set by inertia and stiffness  
    If its sloshing period matches the tidal period, sympathetic vibration occurs
    
      
    
3. How does water in a wave move?
    
    1. It circles, but remains approximately in place
      
      
    
    Only the wave structure travels across the water  
    Surface waves itself circles as the wave passes  
    …
    
      
      
    
4. How is a tsunami different from normal waves?
    
    1. They have much longer wavelengths
      
    3. The longer the wavelength of surface wave
        
        - The faster it travels
        - The deeper it extends into the water
        - The more power it conveys for its amplitude
    4. Tsunamis are
        
        - Very long in wavelength and have deep and powerful waves
        - Not strictly surface waves
5. Why do waves bend and break near shore?
    
    1. Shallow water alters the motion of surface waves
      
    
 
The sun also impacts tides  
Sun's tidal bulges are 1/3 the moons
 
**The tides are strongest near the equator because that is where the**  
**A) tidal bulges caused by the moon are tallest**
   

Water in a confined channel can slosh  
It has a stable equilibrium: level  
It has springlike restoring forces
 
Sloshing in a channel involves standing waves  
Water in a finite channel has standing wave modes  
Nodes and antinodes don’t move
 
Waves in open waters are travelling waves  
Water in an infinite sea has traveling wave modes  
Crests and troughs move
   

Sloshing involves deep water waves  
All of the water moves back and forth during a cycle  
Waves on the open sea are surface water waves  
Only the surface water moves during a cycle
   

**Why does a tidal cycle take more than 12 hours?**  
**A) The Moon orbits the Earth**
    
A surface wave slows as water gets shallower  
Its circling motion is distorted by the rising seabed  
Its wavelength decreases  
Its crests grow taller and more tightly bunched  
Wave breaks when the water cant from a crest  
If the seabed slopes gradually, there is rolling surf  
If the seabed slopes sharply, plunging breakers occur
 
Waves experience reflection  
Changes in wave speed cause partial reflection  
The bigger the speed change, the more reflection
 
Waves experience refraction  
Changes in wave speed can redirect the wave  
Waves bend toward shore as they slow in shallowing water
 
**Suppose a water wave strikes a very large solid barrier, such as a cliff. The wave will redirect its motion through**  
**A) Reflection**
 
Summary

- The moon's gravity causes the tides
- The tides can cause resonant motion in channels
- Tidal resonances are standing waves
- The open sea exhibits traveling waves
- Water moves in circles in those waves
- Waves break when the water gets too shallow

10.1 - Static Electricity
 
Observations

- Objects can accumulate static electricity
- Clothes in the dryer often develop static charge
- Objects with static charge may ding or repel
- Static electricity can cause shocks
- Static electricity can make your hair stand up
 
6 Questions

1. Why do some clothes cling while others repel?
    
    1. They carry electric charges that attract or repel
      
    3. Electric charges comes in 2 types
        
        - Charges of the same type repel
        - Charges of opposite types attract
        - Franklin named the types positive and negative
    4. Charge is actually a single conserved quantity
      
    
2. Why do clothes normally neither cling nor repel?
    
    1. Clothes normally have 0 net charge
      
    
    Electric charge
    
    4. Is intrinsic to some subatomic particles
    5. Is quantized in multiples of the fundamental charge
    6. Is +1 for proton, -1 for electron
      
    
    Equal protons and electrons -> 0 net charge
    
      
    
    Contact can transfer electrons between objects  
    A dryer charges clothes via these effects
    
      
    
3. Why does distance weaken static effects?
    
    1. Forces between charges decrease as 1/distance^2
    2. They obey Coulomb's law
    3. Electrical charge is measured in coulombs
    4. 1 fundamental charge is 1.6 * 10^-19 coulombs
      
    
4. Why do clingy clothes stick to uncharged walls?
    
    1. The charged clothes polarize the wall
      
    
    - The wall's positive charges shift toward the sock
    - The walls negative charges shift away from it
    - …
    - …
    
      
    
5. Why do clingy clothes crackle as they separate?
    
    1. Separating opposite charges boosts voltages
      
    3. Charge has electrostatic potential energy (EPE)
    4. Voltage measures the EPE per unit of charge
        
        - Work raises voltage of positive charge
        - Work lowers voltage of negative charge
        - Voltage is measured in volts (joules / coulomb)
      
      
    
6. Why do some things lose their charge quickly?
    
    1. Charge can escape thru electric conductors
      
    3. Insulators have no mobile electric charges
    4. Conductors have mobile electric charges
        
        - Usually electrons but can be ions
        - That will accelerate and flow toward lowest EPE
    5. Conductors allow charges to cancel or escape
       
Rubbing diff objects together ensures  
Excellent contact between their surfaces  
Significant charge transfer from 1 to the other
 
**A positive charge and a negative charge will**  
**A) attract each other**
    
When a negatively charged sock nears the wall,
    
**Electrons are**  
**A) much lighter than protons**
    
**You have just pulled your clothes from the dryer and find that a sock is clinging to your jeans with static electricity. You hold the jeans in one hand and the sock in the other and pull the 2 apart. As jeans and sock move apart, the forces between them become weaker because the**  
**A) distance between the garments increase**  
￼Summary

- All objects contain countless charges
- Objects can transfer charge during contact
- Clothes often develop net charges during drying
- Oppositely charged clothes cling to one another and spark as separation raises their voltages
- Conductivity tends to let objects neutralize
