Ball Sports: bouncing
 
Observations about Bouncing Balls

- Some balls bounce better than others
- Dropped balls don’t rebound to their full height
- Balls bounce differently from different surfaces
- Balls bounce differently from moving objects
 
4 questions about bouncing balls

1. Why doesn’t a ball rebound to its original height?
    
    1. It wastes some of its energy during the bounce
    
    - While rebounding from the floor, the balls
        
        - Elastic potential energy decreases as it undents
        - Kinetic energy increases by the rebound energy
    - Not all collision energy becomes rebound energy 
- 2 common measurements of a ball's livliness:
    
    - Coefficient of restitution = rebound speed / collision speed
    - Energy ratio = rebound energy / collision energy

4. Why does the floor's surface affect the bounce?
    
    1. If the floor dents, it also receives collision energy
      
    3. The denting floor stores and returns energy
        
        - Floor also has an energy ratio that effects the bounce
    4. Impact forces on ball & floor: equal and opposite
    5. A soft, lively floor can help the ball bounce
      
    
5. How does a moving bat drive a ball forward?
    
    1. Ball bounces off bat in the bat's frame of reference
      
    3. When bat and ball are moving toward one another
        
        - Collision speed is their speed of approach
        - Rebound speed is their speed of separation
    4. The bat's inertial frame of reference
        
        - Is the perspective in whichh bat's center of mass appears motionless
        - And the ball appears to bounce off the motionless bat
          
        
        Ball @ 100mph  
        Bat speed @ 100mph  
        Collision speed @ 200mph
        
          
        
        Ball @110  
        Bat @ 100  
        Coll @ 210
        
          
        
6. What happens to the bat when a ball hits it?
    
    1. It accelerates, angularly accelerates, and vibrates
        
        - Transfers momentum and angular momentum to the bat
        - Can deform the bat, causing it to vibrate
        - Increases with the stiffness of the bat and ball
        - Lasts longer when the bat and ball are livelier
 
While slowing as it hits a rigid floor, a balls

- Kinetic energy decreases by the collision energy
- Elastic potential energy increases as it dents
 
Measuring a Ball's Liveliness
 
Since KE = speed^2

- Energy ratio = restitution coefficient^2           
The balls impact force on the bat
 
Summary about bouncing balls

- Each ball has a coefficient of restitution
- Energy lost in a bounce becomes thermal
- The bouncing surface can affect a balls bounce
- Surfaces bounce too!

Section 3.3 - Carousels and Roller Coasters
 
Observations about carousels and roller coasters

- You can feel your motion with your eyes closed
- You feel pulled in unusual directions
- You sometimes feel weightless
- You can become inverted without feeling it
 
5 questions about carousels and roller coasters

1. What aspects of motion do you feel?
    
    1. You feel acceleration, but not velocity
      
      
    
2. Why do you feel flung outward on a carousel?
    
    1. You are accelerating inward on the carousel
      
    
    Riders undergo uniform circular motion
    
      
    
    Acceleration = velocity^2 / radius
    
      
    
3. Why do you feel light as a roller coaster dives?
    
    1. Your feeling of acceleration is upward
      
    
4. Why do you feel heavy as a roller coaster turns?
    
    1. Your feeling of acceleration is outward
      
    
5. How do you stay seated on a loop-de-loop?
    
    1. You are accelerating downward very rapidly
 
Not a real force  
A sensation caused by inertia  
You feel an apparent weight  
Weight + accel
      

Centripetal acceleration  
Points away from the center of motion and is a sensation due to inertia, not a real force
      

Choosing a Seat

- As you go over cliff-shaped hills,
    
    - Accel is downward, feeling of accel is upward
- The faster you dive over the first hill
    
    - The greater the downward accel
    - The stronger the upwardforce of accel
- First car drives slowly – weak weightlessness
- Last car drives slowly – strong weightlessness

4.1 Bicycles
 
Observations

- Hard to keep upright stationary
- Stay upright while moving
- Require leaning thru turns
- Can be ridden without hands
 
Questions

1. Why is a stationary tricycle stable?
    
    1. The tricycle is in a stable equilibrium
2. Why is a stationary bike unstable?
    
    1. The bicycle is in an unstable equilibrium
      
    
3. Why does a moving trike flip during turns?
    
    1. Inertial effects overwhelm its static stability
      
    
4. Why do you lean bikes thru turns?
    
    1. To balance inertial effects with static instability
    
    Get the bike to drive under rider's center of gravity
     6. Why can you ride a bike w/o hands?
    
    1. It automatically steers under center of gravity

Has restoring influences that tend to return the trike to equilibrium  
If center of grav is above base of support:

- Grav pot energy increases as it tips
- It accels opposite that tip
- Returns to equilibrium

Rockets and Space Travel
 
Observations

- Rockets seem to ride torchlike flames
- Rockets can accelerate straight up
- Rockets can go very fast
- The flame only touches the ground initially
- Rockets can apparently operate in empty space
- Rockets usually fly nose-first
 
Questions

1. What pushes a rocket forward?
    
    1. Its gaseous exhaust pushes it forward
 
Momentum(ship) = -momentum(fuel) = -mass(fuel) * velocity(fuel)
 
The greater the fuel mass and backward velocity, the greater the ship's forward momentum

1. How does the rocket use gas to obtain thrust?
    
    1. It redirects gas's thermal motion into a directed jet
2. What keeps a rocket pointing forward?
3. What limits a spaceship's speed, if anything?
4. Once in space, does a spaceship have a weight?
5. What makes a spaceship orbit the earth?
