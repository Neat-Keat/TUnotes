SKATING
 
Observations about Skating

- When youre at rest on a level surface
    
    - Without a push, you remain stationary
    - With a push, you start moving in that direction
- When youre moving on a level surface
    
    - Without a push, you coast steady and straight
    - With a push, you change direction or speed
 
4 questions about skating

1. Why do stationary skaters remain so?
    
    1. A body at rest tends to remain at rest
        
        1. This observed behavior is called inertia
          
        
2. Why do moving skaters remain so?
    
    1. A body in motion tends to remain in motion
        
        1. This behavior is the second half of inertia
          
        
3. Why do skaters need ice or wheels to skate?
    
    1. Real world complications usually mask inertia
        
        1. Solution, minimize or overwhelm complications
    2. To observe inertia, therefore
        
        - Work on level ground (minimize gravity's effects)
        - Use wheels, ice, or air support (minimize friction)
        - Work fast (overwhelm friction and air resistance)
4. How does a skater start or stop moving?
    
    1. A net force causes the skater to accelerate
        
        1. Acceleration – change in velocity with time
        2. Mass – measure of objects's inertia
            
            - Acceleration is yet another vector quantity: the rate and direction of the velocity
      

Every object has mass, the strength of the force of gravity working on its mass determines it's weight (W)

- W = m*g
 
Newton's 1st law:

- An object that is free of external influences moves in a straight line and covers equal distances in equal times
    
    - Note that a motionless object obeys this law!
- An object that is free of external influences moves at a constant velocity
    
    - Note that a motionless object is "moving" at a constant velocity of zero!
 
Newton's 2nd law

- An objects acceleration is equal to the net force exerted on it divided by its mass. That acceleration is in the same direction as the net force
    
    - F = ma
 
Physical Quantities:

1. Position – an object's location
2. Velocity – its change in position with time
3. Both are vector quantities
    
    - Position is distance and direction from a reference
        
        - S = ½ a(0)t^2 + V(0)t+S(0)
        - Velocity is the change of position over time
    - Velocity is speed and direction of motion
        
        - V = at + V
    - Acceleration is the change of velocity over time
        
        - A = a
    - Speed = Distance / Time
4. Force – a push or a pull
    
    1. Force is another vector quantity:
        
        1. The amount and direction of the push or pull
        2. Net force is the vector sum of all forces on an object
 
About Units

- SI or "metric" units:
    
    - Position -> m (meters)
    - Velocity -> m/s (meters-per-second)
    - Acceleration -> m/s^2 (meters-per-second^2)
    - Force -> N (newtons)
    - Mass -> kg (kilograms)
- Newton's second law relates the units:
    
    - 1 m/s^2 = 1 N / 1 kg
 
Summary about Skating

- Skates can free you from external forces
- When you experience no external forces:
    
    - You coast – you move at constant velocity
    - If youre at rest, you remain so
    - If you're moving, you remain so
- When you experience external forces:
    
    - You accelerate – you move at a changing velocity
    - Acceleration depends on force and mass
 
FALLING BALLS
 
Observations about Falling Balls

- When you drop a ball, it
    
    - Begins at rest, but acquires downward speed
    - Covers more and more distance each second
- When you toss a ball straight up, it
    
    - Rises to a certain height
    - Comes momentarily to stop
    - …

5 Questions about Falling Balls:

1. Why do dropped balls fall downward?
    
    - Earths gravity exerts a force on the ball
        
        - That force is the ball's weight
        - That weight points toward Earth's center
        - Its weight causes the falling ball to accelerate downward – toward Earth's center
 
1. Do different balls fall at different rates?
    
    - No they all fall together
        
        - A balls weight is proportional to its mass
            
            - Weight/mass = (9.8)(N/kg)
        - That ratio is equivalent to an scceleration:
            
            - Weight/ mass = f/m = accel
              
            
2. Would a ball fall differently on the moon?
    
    1. Yes!
        
        1. Moons accel due to gravity is 1.6 m/s^2
3. Can a ball..
