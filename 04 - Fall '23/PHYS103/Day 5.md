Seesaws  
￼Observations about Seesaws

- A balanced seesaw rocks back and forth easily
- Equal-weight children balance a seesaw
- Unequal-weight children don’t normally balance
- Moving the heavier child inward restores balance
- Sitting closer to the pivot speeds up the motion
 
6 questions about seesaws

1. How does a balanced seesaw move?
    
    1. At a constant angular velocity
    
    1. Angular position: an objects orientation
    2. Angular velocity – change in angular position with time
    3. Torque – a twist or spin
    
    - Angular position is angle and rotation axis from reference orientation
    - Angular velocity is angular speed and rotation axis
    - Torque is amount and rotation axis of twist or spin
        
        - Think of it as work done around a circle instead of a straight line 3. Why does a seesaw need a pivot?
    
    1. To prevent translational movement (I.e., falling)
4. Why does a lone rider plummet to the ground?
    
    1. Torque on seesaw causes angular acceleration
5. Why do the riders' weights and positions matter?
    
    1. Must balance seesaw – zero net torque
6. Why does distance from the pivot affect speed?
    
    1. Moving toward the pivot reduces rotational mass
    
    Lever arm is a vector from pivot to lever arm  
    Rotational mass is proportional to …. ^2
    
      
    
7. How do the riders twist each other?
    
    1. 2 torques – 1 due to gravity, 1 due to other rider
        
        - A gravitational torque …
      
    

Because the seesaw has rotational inertia!  
Newton's first law of rotational motion  
A rigid object that's not wobbling and that is free of outside torques rotates at constant angular velocity.  
Physical quantities  
All 3 are vector quantities.
 
Pivot is placed at natural pivot – center of mass  
Pivot allows rotation but not translation
 
The weight of a lone rider produces a torque.  
Torque = lever arm * force(perp)  
(where the lever arm is a vector from pivot to location of force)  
That torque would cause angular acceleration  
Seesaw's angular velocity would change with time
 
Vector Quantities:  
4.  
5.
 
Newton's 2nd law of rotational motion  
An objects angular accel is equal to …......
 
Adding a 2nd rider adds a 2nd torque

- The 2 torques act in opposite directions
- If net torque due to gravity is 0, you're in equilibrium    

Each rider experiences 2 torques about pivot:
 
Newton's 3rd law of Rotational Motion  
For every torque that one objects exerts on a second, there is an equal and opposite one
 
Summary about Seesaws

- Balanced seesaw: 0 gravitational torque
- Balanced seesaw has constant angular velocity
- Net torque causes angular accel of seesaw
- Heavier riders need smaller arms

2.2 Wheels
 
Observations about wheels

- Friction makes wheel-less objects skid to a stop
- Friction can waste energy and cause wear
- Wheels mitigate the effects of friction
- Wheels can also propel vehicles
 
5 questions about wheels

1. Why does a wagon need wheels?
    
    1. Friction opposes a wheel-less wagon's motion
      
    
    - Oppose relative sliding motion of 2 surfaces
    - Act along the surfaces to bring them to 1 velocity
    - …
      
    
2. Why is sliding a box hardest at the beginning?
    
    1. Static friction is stronger than sliding friction
3. What happens to energy as a box skids to rest?
    
    1. That energy becomes thermal energy
      
    
    - The 2 surfaces travel different distances
    - The missing work becomes thermal energy
    - The surfaces also experience wear
    
      
    
4. How do wheels help a wagon coast?
    
    1. Wheels can eliminate sliding friction
    
    Wheels and roller bearings eliminate sliding friction
    
5. What energy does a wheel have?
    
    1. Kinetic, both translational and rotational
      
    
    For a translating wheel:  
    KE= ½ mass*speed^2  
    For a rotational wheel:  
    KE= ½ rotational mass * angular speed^2
    

The wheel of a moving vehicle has both!
