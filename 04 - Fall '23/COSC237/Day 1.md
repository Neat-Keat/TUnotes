3 fundamental types of operators in Java

    - Binary
        
        - addition (+)
        - subtraction (-)
        - multiplication (*)
        - division (/)
            
            - if 1 or both of the operands is decimal, you get decimal, else int
                
                - 14 / 7 = 2
                - 14.0 / 7 = 2.0
        - modulus (%)
- relational
    
    - == (equal to)
    - != (not equal to)
    - >
    - <
    - >=
    - <=
- boolean
    
    - (short circuit eval) &&
    - (short circuit eval) ||
    - (full eval) &
    - (full eval) |
    - !
   

int div vs mod
 
1980 / 100 = 19  
1980 % 100 = 80
 
mod is used to cycle thru a set of nums  
num = 0  
num = (num + 1) % 100  
if continually incremented, num will ONLY have values 0-99
