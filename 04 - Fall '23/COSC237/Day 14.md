Teacher not here for class Tuesday, but TA will be to answer questions  
EXAM scheduled for next Thursday  
NO LAB NEXT WEEK
 
How to declare a class?  
What does it mean to have composition?  
Subclasses?  
Polymorphism?
 
Subclasses should have everything the parent class has AND MORE  
Think general address > international address  
YOU CAN HAVE AN ARRAY WITH A MIXTURE OF TYPES OF ADDRESSES
   

SUBCLASS VS SUBTYPE  
You can construct a subclass however you want  
Itâ€™s a subtype if it can do everything the parent can do  
Basically, can your object be used in the same was as its parent class?
 
"you gotta know how to construct a subclass so that it behaves as a subtype"  
What that mean concretely tho?"
