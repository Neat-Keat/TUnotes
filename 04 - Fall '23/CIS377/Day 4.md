Cyber Attacks & Defense  
Lesson 1: Attacks and Attackers
 
Use citations lol
 
Groups after the midterm  
Have a month to work on it  
No websites, no wikipedia articles  
MUST be scholarly articles
 
All questions come directly from slides and textbook  
There IS A REVIEW GUIDE

Their stocks fell lmfao
   

ATTACKERS
 
What are the reasons for an attack?

- Malicious
- Financial
- Competition
 
Define:

- Black hat hacker
    
    - Someone who hacks for their own benefit, regardless of relevant ethics or laws. (NO PERMISSION AND MALICIOUS)
- White hat hacker
    
    - Someone who hacks to promote security and safety (WITH PERMISSION) (think pentesting)
- Grey hat hacker
    
    - A mix of black and white (NO PERMISSION, NOT MALICIOUS) (ANONYMOUS)
- Ethical hacker
    
    - Hacking for good. Same as white hat hackers?
- Hacktivist
    
    - Someone who hacks to bring awareness to a cause
- Nation state hacker
    
    - A hacker sponsored by their government
- Insider threat
    
    - Someone working for a business that attacks them
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
    
    - An attacker who has sophisticated tools and expertise to perform different forms of attacks in order to gain access to a system and remain in the system undetected for as long as possible.
 
Adversarial Thinking

- Think like your attacker to analyze your own system's flaws
 
What is a cyber attack?

- An attack via cyberspace targeting an enterprise's use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/ infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled info."
 
Who can be attacked?

- Individuals
- Organizations/companies
- Nations/countries
 
Attacks on individuals

- Can steal personal records (health records, IP, credit card info) or devices
 
Attacks on Organizations/companies

- Can steal company records (IP, employee records, financial info) or Network systems (servers, routers, etc)
 
Attacks on Nations/Countries

- Can steal national secrets, intelligence, military secrets
 
Components of a cyber attack

- Attacker or agent
    
    - The person or entity conducting the attack
- Intent
    
    - Purpose of the attack
    - Targeted or opportunity attack
- Tactics, techniques, and procedures
    
    - How the attack is conducted
 
Attack techniques or methods

1. Malware attacks
2. Network attacks
3. Application/ web based attacks
4. Human centered
5. Wireless/ mobile attack
 
Any mix is a blended attack
 
MALWARE

Malicious software
 
Define:

- Viruses
    
    - Any piece of code (typically with a malicious intent) that can spread from machine to machine, but only with activity from a user
- Worms
    
    - A self-replicating program that propagates itself thru a network WITHOUT user intervention
- Spyware
    
    - Software that spies on the user, usually installed without their knowledge
- Logic Bombs
    
    - Malicious code in software that is only executed when specific conditions are met (time, day, etc)
- Trojan Horse
    
    - A malicious code hidden in something that seems useful. RATs are trojan attacks designed to gain remote access to a system
- Ransomware
    
    - Malicious code that takes control of system info and demands payment to release it. Can include encryption and money for decryption
- Botnets
    
    - A group of controlled computers from a server used to attack other systems. The bots are added to the botnet with malicious code unbeknownst to the owner
- Rootkit
    
    - A collection of tools used by an attacker operating on a system at the root (admin control) level. The goal is to remain undetected while they operate
- Backdoor
    
    - Malicious software used to gain access to a system remotely without the knowledge of the host system
- Keylogger
    
    - Software (or hardware!) that logs keystrokes on a target system
- Drive-by downloads
    
    - Malicious code that can be downloaded without the knowledge of the host by visiting a malicious site. It can be used to download other types of Malware to the host
   

Define:

- DoS
    
    - Short for Denial of Service, this is where an attacker floods a server with too many bogus requests for it to handle, effectively shutting it down for any legitimate user
- DDoS
    
    - DoS, but done concurrently by a botnet
- MitM
    
    - Intercept information in-transit, stealing important info or redirecting traffic
- SYN Flood Attacks
    
    - A DoS attack where each packet sent has a SYN request, but never responding with SYN/ACK
- Network Sniffing
    
    - Listening to traffic on a network; can be used properly by network admin, but can also let attackers learn about network traffic
- Spoofing
    
    - Impersonating a trusted user in order to get access to a network system
- Ping of Death
    
    - When an attacker sends a request, such as an IP packet, that is ill-formed
