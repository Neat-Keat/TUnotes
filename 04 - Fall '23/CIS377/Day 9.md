Next friday, we need to submit an outline of our paper on BB

- Put as much detail as we can about the paper
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Overview of Incident Response
 
Incident response  
Attacks classified as incidents if they:

- Are directed against info assets
- Have a realistic chance of success
- Could threaten C,I,A of info resources
- Well defined incident response capability assists organization
    
    - Detect incidents rapidly
    - Minimize loss...
    - …
    - …

CIA related incidents

Could threaten any part of the CIA triad

- Recon attacks
- Repudiation – taking an action, then later denying it
- Harassment
- Extortion
- Porn trafficking
- Organized crime activity
- Subversion
- Hoaxes
 
Your network should have

- Structure and organization
    
    - Incidents create chaos
    - Incidents occur in bursts
- Efficiency
- Facilitates the process of responding to incidents
- Facilitates dealing with the unexpected
- Legal considerations
 
Incident Response Planning (IRPs)

- Covers ID of, classification of, and response to an incident
- Prepares IR teams to be ready to react to an incident
- Proactive

Incident Response (IR) is more REACTIVE
 
IR: actions take to deal with an incident

- Cyclic process: learn from incidents to stop new ones
- IRP
- Incident Detection
- Response
- Preventive countermeasures
- Recovery
 
IR considerations

- Abundance of security-related vulnerabilities
- Availability of attack systems and networks
- Actual and potential financial loss
- Potential for adverse media exposure
- Need for efficiency
- Limitations in intrusion detection capabilities
- Legal considerations
    
    - Standard of due care
    - Due diligence
 
IRP Risk assessment / analysis

- Process used to ID and eval risks/threats
- Point in time, risks are dynamic!
- Performed to ID the impact and determine the most serious risks = prioritize risks.
- ID the appropriate action: avoid, share/transfer, mitigate, accept.
- Quantitative – objective = numbers, values, and formulas
- Qualitative – subjective = values, words, experts, probability/impact
 
Determining Risk Probabilities

- Collect date within the org
- Collect data by other orgs
- /...
- …
 
What is the impact financially of an incident?

- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - total loss expected from a single incident in $ and including total cost (hardware, software, data, resources)
- EX – data loss for 200 customers.
    
    - $Data recovery
    - $Credit monitoring
    - $public relations
    - $incident costs – containment, recovery
 
Potential Sources

- DoS
- Web defacement
- Virus and worm attacks
- Malicious active content
- Back door attacks
- Spoofing
- Session tampering, hijacking, replay
- Ransomware
 
IR life cycle

1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and recovery
4. Post incident activities
 
**Preparation**

- Setting up a reasonable set of defenses and controls based on threads
- Creating a set of procedures to deal with the incident efficiently
- Obtaining the resources and personnel to deal with the problem
- Establish an infrastructure to support incident response activity.
 
Preparing for an incident

- Create an IRP
- Develop IR and Reporting procedures
- Establish guidelines for coming with external parties
- Define incident response team services
- Select a team structure and staffing model
- Staff & train the IR team
- Establish and maintain accurate notification mechanisms
- Develop written guidelines for prioritizing incidents
 
Preparing to collect incident data

- Set of objective and subjective data
- Don’t focus on collecting data because its available, focus on collecting data is actionable
- Absolute number are informative, understand how they represent threat and vulnerabilities
- Decide what incident data to collect passed on reporting requirements.
 
Preventing incidents

- Less costly and more effective than reacting to incidents after they occur
- If mitigations are insufficient, high volumes of incidents may occur resulting in overwhelmed resources
- Need adequate resources to actively maintain security of networks, systems and applications = reduced incidents
 
**IR – Detection**  
Accurately detecting and assessing possible incidents often most challenging aspect

- Whether an incident occurred
- If so – type, extent, magnitude

Detection thru diff means

- Automated capabilities – IDS, antivirus SW, log analyzers
- Manual means – user reporrts

Possible Indicators:

- Presence of unfamiliar files
- Execution of unknown programs or processes
- Unusual consumption of computing resources
- Unusual system crashes
 
Probable indicators:

- Activities at unexpected times
- Presence of new accounts
- Reported attacks
- Notification from IDS

Definite indicators:

- Use of dormant accounts
- Changes to logs
- Presence of hacker tools
- Notification by partner or peer
- Notification by hackers
 
When a potential incident is identified:

- IR team quickly analyze and validate it
- Document every step and action
- Determine incident's scope, attack, methods, and targeted vulnerabilities
- Info to prioritize subsequent activities
- Always assume the worst until additional analyses
- Safeguard data
 
Containment Strategies

- Sever affected communication circuits
- Disable or delete compromised accounts
- Reconfigure firewall
- Disable process or service
- Take down email
- Stop all computers and network devices
- Isolate affected channels, processes, services, or computers
- Disconnect from the network
- Increase monitoring levels
- Set traps
- Strike back at the attacker's system

CRITICAL – DECISION MAKING AND COMMUNICATION
 
**IR – ERADICATION**

- Eliminate components of the incident
    
    - Delete malicious code
    - Disable breached accounts
- …
 
- Adhere to containment procedures
- Record all actions
- Define acceptable risks in advance
- Eradication: eliminate the cause of the incident
- Software available for most virus, worm attacks
- Procedures are very important
 
**IR – REACTION**

- Actions outlined in the IRP
- Guide the org
    
    - Stop the incident
    - Mitigate the impact
    - Provide info recovery
- Notify key personnel
- Document incident
 
**IR – RECOVERY**

- Get everyone moving and focused
- ID and resolve vulnerabilities
    
    - Address safeguards
    - Eval monitoring capabilities
    - Restore data from clean backups
    - Rebuild systems from scratch
    - Restore processes and services
    - Continuously monitor system
    - Change passwords and tighten network perimeter security
    - Restore confidence
 
**IR – POST INCIDENT**  
Perform a postmortem analysis on each significant incident.

- Exact description and timeline
- Adequacy of staff response
- What info was needed at what time?
- What would the staff do differently?
- How was interaction with management?
- What was the damage?
 
- Use for legal reasons: forensically sound evidence
    
    - Includes monetary damage
- Reevaluation and modification of staff response
    
    - Ex: break-in at human genome database
    - Nobody knew who had called when more info was needed
    - Gap in procedure was remedied during follow-up
 
**IR – Methodology**

- Methodology is needed to deal with quickly evolving, chaotic situations
- Ensure policies are in place including comm channels and responsibilities.
- Takes time to implement and learn
    
    - Use mock events/table-top exercises for training
    - …
    - …
 
**Disaster Recovery Plan (DRPs)**

- Provide guidance in the event of a disaster
- Clear establishment of priorities
- Clear delega....
- ....
- …
 
Crisis Management

- Disaster recovery personnel must know their responses without any supporting documentation
- Actions taken during and after a disaster focusing on people involved and addressing viability of business
- Crisis management team responsible for managing event from an enterprise perspective and covers:
    
    - Support personnel and loved ones
    - Determine impact on normal operations
    - Keep public informed
    - Communicate with major players
 
**Business Continuity Plan (BCPs)**

- Outlines reestablishment of critical business operations during a disaster that impacts operations
- If disaster has rendered the business unusable for continued operations, there must be a plan to allow business to continue functioning
- Dev of BCP somewhat simpler than IRP or DRP; consists primarily of selecting a continuity strategy and integrating off-site data storage and recovery functions into this strategy
 
Strategies

- Thers a number of Business Continuity plans
- Determining factor in selecting between options usually cost
- In general there are 3 exclusive options:
    
    - Hot sites
    - Warm sites
    - Cold sites
- Three shared functions: time-share; service bureaus; and mutual agreements
 
Alt site configs

- Hot sites:
    
    - Fully configured computer facilities
    - All services & comm links
    - Physical plant operations
- Warm sites
    
    - Does not include actual applications
    - Apps may not be installed and configured
    - Required hours to days to become operational
- Cold sites
    
    - Rudimentary services and facilities
    - No hardware or peripherals
    - Empty room
 
- Time shares:
    
    - Hot, warm, or cold
    - Leased with other orgs
- Service bureau
    
    - Provides service for a fee
- Mutual agreements
    
    - A contract between 2+ ors that specifies how each will assist the other in the event of a disaster
 
**Off-site disaster data storage**

- To get sites up and running quickly, orgs must have ability to port data into new sites's systems
- Electronic vaulting
    
    - Transfer of large batches of data
    - Receiving server archives data
    - Fee
- Journaling
    
    - Transfer of live transactions to off-site
    - Only transactions are transferred
    - Transfer is real time.
 
Shadowing:

- Duplicated databases
- Multiple servers
- Processes duplicated
- 3+ copies simultaneously
 
Model for a consolidated contigency plan

- Single document set supports concise planning and encourages smaller orgs to develop, test,…
- …

￼The planning Document  
6 steps in Contingency planning process

1. ID mission or business critical functions
2. ID resources that support critical functions
3. Anticipating potential contingencies or disasters
4. Selecting contingency planning strategies
5. Implementing contingency strategies
6. Testing and revising strategy
 
Why an incident team?

Law Enforcement Involvement

- When incident at hand constitutes a violation of law, organization may determine involving law enforcement is necessary
- Questions
    
    - When should an org involve law enforcement?
    - What level of law enf should be involved?
    - What happens when they get involved?
- Some Qs are best answered by org's legal department  
Benefits and drawbacks of law enforcement involvement

- Benefits
    
    - Agencies may be better equipped at processing evidence
    - Org may be less effective in convicting suspects
    - Law enf agencies prepared to handle warrants and subpoenas needed
    - Law enforcement skilled at obtaining witness statements and other info collection
-
