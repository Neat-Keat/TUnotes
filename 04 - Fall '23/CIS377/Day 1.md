-----------------------------------------------------------  
Lecture 1 (cyber foundations)
 
Swbat

- Describe cybersecurity and its importance
- Understand whats being protected
- Understand historical lessons
- Describe security principles and key terms, including the CIA triad
- Identify top threats and assess the likelihood of an attack
- Compare and contract approaches to network security
 
Computer systems are around us

- Online banking
- Automated supermarket checkouts
- Online classes
- Online shopping
- Online travel resources
- Ebay, amazon, half.com
- Expedia
 
No tech is 100% safe

- Cyber cant be a check the box activity, it has to be structured and purposeful
- Cs must protect all company assets
    
    - Personnel (1st priority)
    - Data
    - Hardware
    - software

Cyber facts

- Digital assets are >85% of most orgs value
- 99% of info is stored digitally
- Avg us data breach is $3.6 mil
- Annual cost of cyber crime >$8.8 trillion
- Cost of a breach of PII averages $148 per record, up 5%
- Facebook collects 15 TB of data daily
 
CS requires resources, but we don’t have enough

- %=$15 bil for CS related activities in 2019
- Cyber budgets ~5-7 of an IT budget

What is CS?

- DOD says
    
    - "the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of electronic systems...
- "measures taken to protect a computer or computer system against unauthorized access or attack
 
CS began as a research projecy

- Creeper Bot in 1971
    
    - Modified into Reaper
- Late 80's, viruses became a serious threat
- 1988 Robert Morris

￼CIA TRIAD

- Confidentiality
    
    - Data confidentiality
    - Privacy
- Integrity
    
    - Data integrity
    - System integrity
- Availability

5 components for protection

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Think like an adversary
- Defense in depth

What are we protecting?

- Data
    
    - Corporate and personnel info
- Identity
    
    - Personal info
- Devices and infrastructure
    
    - Computing and network resources

Protecting Data  
Personally Identifiable Info (PII)  
Any info used to distinguish or trace your id, such as name, SSN, date/place of birth, mothers maiden name  
Protected Health Info (PHI)  
Medical info, lab history, hospital records, medical insurance info, etc  
Financial info  
Data: most valuable organizational asset

- Data at Rest
- Data in Transit
- Data in Use
 
Data/Network Breach

- Any event where an individuals name and medical record or financial record or debit card is potentially put at risk
- 3 main causes
    
    - Malicious/criminal attack
    - System glitch
    - Human error
- Costs vary according to cause and safeguards in place

US is 3rd in most breaches  
US is 1st in cost of breaches
 
Cost of data breach  
1st Health  
2nd Financial  
3rd Energy  
4th Industrial  
5th Pharma  
6th Tech
 
Protect the Network: Critical Infrastructure

- The comp sci act of 1987
- PDD-63

Critical Infrastructure differs across sectors

- Chemical sector =/ banking sector
 
Emerging Trends

- More intelligence driven and automated
    
    - Specifically AI based
- Cloud-based security
    
    - Security as a service
- Growth and diversity of mobile devices
    
    - Hard to use unified protection mechanisms
- Cryptojacking
- Smarter IoT (internet of things) based Botnets
    
    - Hack one thing, get the whole network

Think like an adversary

- How would I attack myself?
    
    - How can I prevent that?

Network security paradigms

- Perimeter security approach
    
    - Most popular, but getting less and less clearly defined
- Layered security approach
    
    - Perimeter + separate sections are protected
- Proactive vs reactive
    
    - Do you have a plan for being attacked?
- Hybrid security method
 
Defense in depth  
Abstraction  
Layering  
Modularity  
Resource encapsulation  
Process isolation  
Domain separation
 
Defense

- Most companies focus overwhelmingly on encryption and perimeter defense
 
Keep it simple (KISS)

- Minimization
- Simplicity
- Complexity is the worst enemy of security
- Easy-to-use and unified info sec systems are going to be more effective bc of their simplicity to roll out and manage
 
Lessons Learned

- Anyone and everyone is susceptible
- Hackers continuously evolve
- Overseas attacks and state-sponsored attacks have increased drastically
- Insider threats just as dangerous as outsiders
- Hackers arent leaving, its profitable
- Attack on national critical infrastructure is imminent bc of inherent poor protection
- Advanced persistent threat and state sponsored groups continue to attack w more sophistication

Summary

- Cyber security is constantly changing, its DYNAMIC
- You need to protect data and networks
- Three critical concepts: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
    
    - The CIA Triad
 
Legal constraints impact network security

- The CS act of 1987
- OMB circular !-130
- www.alw.nih.gov
- HIPAA
 
Online Resources

- CERT
- Microsoft Security Advisor
- F-Secure
