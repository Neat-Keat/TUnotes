==I have seen that the dining halls do have healthy food options; however, there is far more junk food being served than healthy food. It is common to see pizza, burgers, fries, and an assortment of fried foods being served at every dining hall, which can make students feel forced to eat junk food for their meals. This is unacceptable because students should be eating healthier foods to perform their best academically. I kindly recommend that you look at your dining halls on campus and start feeding your students healthy foods rather than junk food.==

==I have seen that the dining halls do have healthy food options; however, the amount of healthy food being served is far outnumbered by junk food. It is common for every dining hall to serve pizza, burgers, fries, and an assortment of fried foods, making junk food seem like the only option for students' meals. Healthy food is necessary for ideal academic performance from students, rendering junk food unacceptable. Dining halls need to serve students healthy food instead of junk food, and I kindly recommend that you make changes to accomplish this.==

==Quantitative research uses numbers in collecting and interpreting data. Experimental studies and quantitative descriptive studies are the two primary methods of quantitative research. Five basic concepts are fundamental to quantitative research methodology: reliability, validity, randomization, probability, and the null hypothesis. Scholars grant credibility and importance to the results of a quantitative research project based on the qualities of reliability and validity. To rule out rival hypotheses (alternative explanations) and control threats to reliability and validity, randomization is an important strategy in good study design. When readers interpret the results of an experiment, probability plays an important role.==
