Beginning January 1, your monthly payment for health care benefits will be increased to $119 (up from $52 last year).  
Every year health care costs go up. Although we consider dropping other benefits, a decision was made that our best option was to keep the present comprehensive package. Unfortunately, we canâ€™t do that unless we pass along some of the extra cost to you. Last year the company was forced to absorb the total increase in health care premiums. However, such a plan this year is inadvisable.  
We did everything possible to avoid the sharp increase in costs to you this year. A rate schedule describing the increase in payments for your family and dependents is enclosed.
