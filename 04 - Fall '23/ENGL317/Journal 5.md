**ORIGINAL JOURNAL #3**  
As a future employee, I believe I have a lot to bring to the table. Most relevantly, I would say that my expertise in creating multimedia products is my biggest asset. I attended Cecil County School of Technology, a trade school which not only taught me how to use various professional-grade creation applications like Adobe Photoshop and Unity, but I also have Adobe's Creative Associate certificates in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Animate, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. I have used these skills to grow my own personal brand, having amassed 403.5 thousand likes on Tiktok with two videos reaching over a million views. If you hire me, I can use these skills not only to help develop your own social media identity, but also work on things like the frontend of your website or any advertising material you need.

be more critical, what are that document's flaws?  
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
ChatGPT  
Certainly, let's take a more critical look at the document and identify its flaws:  
**Lack of Specific Job Relevance**: While the candidate mentions their skills and achievements, they don't directly tie them to the specific requirements or responsibilities of the job they are applying for. It would be more effective to explicitly relate their skills to how they would benefit the prospective employer in this particular role.  
**Overemphasis on Personal Achievements**: While personal achievements like TikTok success are impressive, they may not be directly relevant to all job positions. The candidate spends a significant portion of the document discussing personal branding, which might not be the primary focus of the job they are applying for. It's important to prioritize and emphasize skills and experiences that align with the job description.  
**Lack of Metrics**: The document mentions that the candidate has "amassed 403.5 thousand likes on Tiktok with two videos reaching over a million views," but it doesn't provide context or metrics for their other achievements. Metrics help quantify the impact of their work and make their accomplishments more tangible.  
**Assumptions about Employer's Needs**: The candidate assumes that the employer needs help with social media and web development without knowing the specific needs of the company. It would be more effective to research the company's requirements and tailor their pitch accordingly.  
**Not Addressing Soft Skills**: While technical skills are important, the document doesn't touch upon soft skills like teamwork, communication, or problem-solving, which are often crucial in a professional environment. A well-rounded candidate should demonstrate a balance between technical and interpersonal skills.  
**Repetitive Phrasing**: The candidate repeatedly uses phrases like "I believe I have a lot to bring to the table" and "If you hire me, I can use these skills." This repetition can make the document sound less engaging and more formulaic.  
**Lengthy Introduction**: The initial sentence, "As a future employee," is somewhat vague and can be seen as filler. It's better to get straight to the point and grab the employer's attention with a concise introduction.  
In summary, the document could benefit from more focus on the specific job requirements, metrics to support achievements, and a more tailored approach to addressing the employer's needs. Additionally, a more concise and engaging writing style would improve its overall effectiveness.
