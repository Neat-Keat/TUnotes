1. If I were to start my career in computer science, there are three companies I would like to work for: The Boss Group, Creative Circle, and Sparks Group.
2. I looked at each website and wanted to know if I could trust any of these staffing recruiters, If they are legit, and if it takes a long time to contact or stay in contact with those that put resumes in to be employed
3. The positions can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the work ethic of that individual.
4. I started to put in perspective what all the agencies - The Boss Group, Sparks Group, and Creative Circle - have in common or different.
5. The Boss Group does have peak periods when their clients need immediate workers; it's normally around the summer, fall, and holidays.
6. Most of the staff are personable. Without that, the job would be hard to do.
7. The edge we have over similar organizations is that we are teaming up with the Baltimore City Police and Fire Departments.
8. This gives us a high number of proactive volunteers: people who already have a passion for this mission.
