And  
Heres some info on how to file a claim  
Use these steps to file a claim

- Attend a meeting?
- Submit a proposal?
- Use info to inform a decision?
- Consider a request?
 
You want them to take an action that benefits you or your org?
 
Whats the use of framing a document as a problem?  
"I want to tell this team how disappointed I am that we didn't meet our goal."  
Instead, its better to frame it positively by indicating a solution.  
"here's how I want our team to go about meeting our goal in the future."
 
Don’t write for a general audience  
Don’t write for the person who asked you to do the writing if that isnt the actual audience
 
Who needs to know my paper's info?  
Prof C, or the CEO?
 
Why this might matter:  
Prof C might need more explaining about the company than the CEO
 
What is the audience's existing knowledge of the topic, and what do they need to know?
 
If the audience doesn’t know much abt the topic, avoid using very technical language or jargon.
 
If you must use jargon, provide theim with aids for understanding, such as pictures, examples, or definitions
 
Ex.  
The police department announces on social media, "Main Street will be closed tomorrow for drain work". But because "drain work" in this context is both jargon and vague, they go on to define it
 
Adding too much or too little info:  
Woult it be necessary to define all the criteria that we are using to eval a company in the CEO's industry?
 
Sample purpose statement:  
"this document explains to faculty how to submit their grades electronically"  
Addresses who's the audience and what's the purpose.
