**Some astonishing questions about the nature of the universe** have been raised by scientists exploring the nature of black holes in space. **A black hole** is created when a dead star collapses into a very small point. **So much matter compressed into so little volume** changes the fabric of space around it in profoundly puzzling ways.

I am writing this letter to express my concern about the inconvenient dining hall schedules on campus, particularly the dining services that close at 7 pm, and how it conflicts with the schedules of Towson students. This issue could be alleviated by extending the dining hall hours of all dining services to 11 pm or 12 am at the latest. This would ensure that students wouldnâ€™t have to rush or skip meals and could utilize all the dining options that Towson has to offer. I am a freshman here at Towson University. On behalf of the Towson students who have experienced challenges with the availability of on-campus dining, I would like to address the pressing issue and recommend solutions in hopes of bringing about change for the benefit of all students.
