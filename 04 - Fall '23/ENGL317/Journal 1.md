Nvidia as a company interests me for a variety of reasons. The most relevant of which is that I own a computer with Nvidia's RTX 2060 card in it! However, I also come from a computer science background, with a particular interest in graphics, and from what I know about Nvidia already, they are on the forefront of developing new techniques related to this, like optimizing existing rendering techniques and introducing entirely new techniques to the industry. I will say that I was surprised when I noticed that their market cap was an entire magnitude greater than their competitors, as I largely see Nvidia and AMD specifically essentially equal competitors in the industry.
