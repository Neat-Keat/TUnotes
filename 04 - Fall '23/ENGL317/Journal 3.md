As a future employee, I believe I have a lot to bring to the table. Most relevantly, I would say that my expertise in creating multimedia products is my biggest asset. I attended Cecil County School of Technology, a trade school which not only taught me how to use various professional-grade creation applications like Adobe Photoshop and Unity, but I also have Adobe's Creative Associate certificates in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Animate, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. I have used these skills to grow my own personal brand, having amassed 403.5 thousand likes on Tiktok with two videos reaching over a million views. If you hire me, I can use these skills not only to help develop your own social media identity, but also work on things like the frontend of your website or any advertising material you need.
