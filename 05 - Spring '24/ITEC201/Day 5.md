Midterm march 26th  
Open from 4-9pm
 
13 essay questions, top 10 are graded  
"write as much as possible"  
"generous with the grading"
 
Spacing issues with phase 1 example  
Phase 1 is only worth 30 pts (phase 4 is 70)
 
This sets you up for success for future group projects  
Put some effort in  
Cant be brutal with grading
