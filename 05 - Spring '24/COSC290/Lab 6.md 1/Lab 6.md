Flip flops and latches: used in memory management – registers and ram  
Hold and manipulate data in a circuit
 
Memory storage  
Latch  
Operated when the clock is active (clock = 1)  
Not synchronized within the computer system!  
Flip flop  
Operated only at the edges (rising or falling) of the clock
