Gabriel Amaizu  
"p simple lab"  
"try to make it as simple as possible"
 
Might be Lab quiz on week 15
 
No lab week 6 or 7?
 
Lab has 3 sections, hardware, software, assembly
 
We use logism for software and a text editor for assembly
 
Assignments graded according to due date?
 
Lab assignments due monday @ midnight?

Voltage (V)

- Electrical potential difference (electric tension)
- A pressure of electric power

Current (I)

- A flow of electric charge

Resistance (R)

- The opposition to the passage of an electric current
- Disrupt the electric current

Resistor

- Holds Resistance

Capacitor (condenser)

- Stores electric energy

Electrons move from the positive node of a battery thru the circuit into the negative end
 
Anode = negative  
Cathode = positive
 
Charging a battery is just moving electrons from positive to negative
 
Ohm's Law  
V = IR

Voltage is directly proportional to current  
Think of resistance as a constant of proportionality
 
Voltage fluctuates, resistance is constant
 
Add units of measurement when doing calculation
 
Series vs parallel circuits
    ![Series case • Series case Parallel ](Exported%20image%2020240525213128-2.png)  

I(total) = I(1) + I(2)  
V(total) = V(1) + V(2)  
1/R(total) = 1/R(1) + 1/R(2)

|---|---|
|Series|I(total) = I(1) = I(2)  <br>V(total) = V(1) + V(2)  <br>R(total) = R(1) + R(2)|
|Parallel|I(total) = I(1) + I(2)  <br>V(total) = V(1) = V(2)  <br>1/R(total) = 1/R(1) + 1/R(2)|
   

Breadboard

- A construction base for prototyping of electronics
- Do not require soldering or destruction to tracks and are hence reusable

Pros

- Solderless (instead, plug!)
- Reusable

Multimeter

- An electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one

Usage

- To measure a resistor
- To measure voltage
- To do continuity test

Caution

- Please turn off your multimeter whenever you are not measuring your electronic component
 
Resistors

- A passive 2 terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element

When calculating resistance with both series AND parallel, solve each parallel, then sub that value in and treat it as a single series resistor
