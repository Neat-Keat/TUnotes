Truth Table

- Truth table helps understand the behavior of logical gates
    
    - It shows how the inputs of a logic gate relate to its output(s)
    - The gate input(s) are shown in the left column(s) of the table with all the different possible input combinations
    - The gate output(s) are shown in the right hand side column

- Logical Gate
    
    - Is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function
    - Consists of diodes, transistors, relays, fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements
    - Performs a logical operation on one or more logical inputs and produces a single logical output
      
    
    Input1 + Input2 -> (logical circuit) -> output
    
      
    
   

Basic Logical Gates: Bitwise operation

- Definition
    
    - To operate on 1 or more bit patterns at the level of their individual bits
- Bitwise operators
    
    - AND gate
    - OR gate
    - NOT gate
    - XOR gate

NOT gate

- The NOT gate is an electronic circuit that produces an inverted version of the input at its output.
- If the input variable is A, the inverted output is known as NOT A. This is also shown as ~A, A', or A with a bar over the top, as shown at the output.
