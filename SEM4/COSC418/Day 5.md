![3.8 A SEVEN-STEP STRATEGY FOR EVALUATING ARGUMENTS The following strategy , which consists Of seven Steps, summarizes the techniques we used in Sections 3.3—3.7 to evaluate an argument's overall strength Of reasoning: Step Convert the argument into standard form. (List the followed by the conclusion.) ](Exported%20image%2020240525213147-2%201.png) ![Step 2. Step 3. Step 4. Step S. Step 6. Step 7. Test the argument for its strength Of reasoning to see whether it is valid or invalid. Strategv: the to be true, and zesk yourself whether the conclusion must also be true when thcxse are true. Is a counterexample to the argument pcßible? Is the argument valid? If yes, go to Step 4. If no, go to Step 5. Is the (valid) argument also sound? 'Illat is, are the true in the actual world? TO determine whether a claim i; true or false in the actual world, see the guidelines in Appendix G (available at www.wileycom/college/ tavani). a. If the argument is valid and if all of the are true in the actual world, then the argument is ab;o sound. b. If the argument is valid, but one or more premises can be shown to be false, then the argument is unsound. (Note that if one or more premises are unable to be verified, i.e., determined to be either true or false, then the overall argument is inconclusive.) Is the (invalid) argument inductive or fallacious? Strategv: TO determine this, ask how likely the conclusion would be true when the premises are true. a. If the conclusion would likely be true because the premises are true (i.e., the evidence for the conclusion is strong), the argument is inductive. b. If the conclusion would not likely be true even when the are true, the argument i; fallacious. Note: Keep in mind that a fallacious argument can be made up Of individual claims or statements that are themselves true in the actual world. Determine whether the premises in your argument are either true or fake in the actual world. Consult the guidelines for determining the truth or falsity Of State- ments in Appendix G, available at www Aviley.com/college/tavani. Make an overall assessment Of the argument by determining both (a) the argument's strength Of rcqesoning (valid, inductive, or fallacious) and (b) the truth conditions Of each Of the argument's premises. Determine, for example, whether the argument's overall strength is sound valid but unsound inductive With all true premises, inductive With some false premises, ](Exported%20image%2020240525213147-3%201.png) ![fallacious With a mixture Of true and fake some other combination. ](Exported%20image%2020240525213147-4%201.png)
