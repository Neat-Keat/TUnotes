we get resubmission opportunities ðŸ‘€

look into Towson SOS (Student Outreach and Support)
	useful for those with personal/family issues that'll take you out of class for a while

email him in case you do have to miss class lol

## On Generative AI
> "the only thing that I ask is that the usage of these tools be disclosed"

they probably wont do too much on these assignments, as we'll largely be working with existing databases

teacher wont help debug AI-generated code tho lolol

also just generally cite any code that you use

get SVN installed for next week
