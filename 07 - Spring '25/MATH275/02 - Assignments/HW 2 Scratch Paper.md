the equation for a sphere at center (a,b,c) with radius r is:
$$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2 $$

1. find eq of the sphere passing through (1,8,5) with center (4,1,-5)

the distance between the two points (radius) is calculated as: $$|PQ| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2+ (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$
$$|PQ| = \sqrt{(1 - 4)^2+ (8 - 1)^2 + (5 - (-5))^2}$$
r = $\sqrt{158}$
$$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2 $$
$$\fbox{$(x-4)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+5)^2 = 158$}$$
