REMEMBER:  
Protons are positive (P+)  
Neutrons are neutral (N)  
Electrons are negative (E-)
 
NOTATION:  
Symbols:  
Carbon has 6 protons in the nucleus  
Can have 8 neutrons  
Carbon 8 is written as:  
6+8  
C  
6
 
SO
 
14  
C  
6
 
CARBON 14 IS AN UNSTABLE CARBON ISOTOPE
 
12  
C  
6
 
CARBON 12 IS A STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE
 
----- from now on, notation Is C (p) (p+e) -----
 
Simplest atom is H(1)(1)  
Normal hydrogen  
There's also H(1)(2)  
"heavy hydrogen" (stable)  
There's also H(1)(3)  
Not stable!
   

U(92)(x) is Uranium
 
Two isotopes are:  
U(92)(235)  
U(92)(238)
 
Most nuclei this big are unstable
 
Au(79)(197) has 79 protons and 118 neutrons
   

ALPHA DECAY OF URANIUM-238
 
U(92)(238) ---> He(2)(4)  
---> Th(90)(234) (also unstable, chain leads to lead (x)(206))
   

So what's a half-life anyways?

Its like how you don’t know how long an individual will live  
But you know how long an average a population lives
 
The amount of time it takes half of a sample to decay is called its half-life
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
CARBON 14 DATING!!  
C(6)(14) has a half-life of ~5,500 years  
Impractical for the scale of astronomy, but great for archaeology and the like!
 
Cosmic rays are almost all protons and electrons  
No neutrons bc they decay to protons, electrons, and neutrinos  
N ---> (p+) + (e-) + (V)  
Free neutrons have a half-life ~ 10 min  
Neutrons bound to an atom are stable, saul goodman
 
Cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, the collisions with atomic particles make secondary rays (which include neutrons)! Spare neutrons are likely to collide with atmospheric N(7)(14), making C(6)(14) + p
 
No particles made or destroyed, just rearranged
 
HOWEVER!  
C(6)(14) is unstable, so it decays to N(7)(14)
 
But wait! How do we go from 6 protons and 8 neutrons to 7p and 7n??
 
BETA(-) DECAY!  
N ---> (p+) + (e-) + (V)!!!
 
Beta(+) decay!  
P+ ---> (n) + (e+) + (V)
   

There's actually 3 types of decay: alpha, beta, and gamma!
 
Alpha radiation is when something decays and emits He(2)(4)  
Beta radiation is when something decays and emits electrons  
Gamma radiation is when something decays and emits high energy photons
 
The half life of carbon(6)(14) is 5730 years
   

CO2 in Atmosphere:  
C(14) : C(12)  
1 : 10^8
 
New wood has C(14) that gets replenished from the atmosphere  
Old wood does NOT get replenished, so its age can be derived from the amount of radio activity it gives off
 
If new wood has x radioactivity, and new wood has x/4 radioactivity, then its been 2 half-lives  
2*5730 years = 11460 years

Nitrogen makes up 80% of atmosphere
