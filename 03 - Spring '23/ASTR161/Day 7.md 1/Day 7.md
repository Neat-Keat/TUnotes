Polaris is 90 deg off the Eastern Horizon at the Pole  
Polaris is 0 deg off the Eastern Horizon at the Equator  
Polaris is 39 deg off the Eastern Horizon at Baltimore  
This is your Latitude
 
LATITUDE  
0 deg longitude is at the Greenwich Observatory in London
 
Finding longitude is a timekeeping operation  
If its noon for you and 11am at your base to the East, then you are 15 deg West of your base  
THE EARTH ROTATES 15 DEGREES PER HOUR  
This is the rudimentary idea, the actual application uses the moons of Jupiter to keep time consistent
 
Galileo watched the Eclipses of the Moons of Jupiter (they moved behind Jupiter)  
He then built a Table of when Eclipses would occur  
This table is called an Ephemeris
 
Doesn’t always work bc you cant always see Jupiter  
Worked better on land than at sea  
Used to revise maps of Earth
 
Ephemeris was tabulated for NH, but could be developed to work for SH
 
CASSINI brought in RO/MER  
He watched the eclipses of Io  
He noticed that at parts of the year, Io would eclipse Jupiter a bit earlier/ later
   
![Superior Planet (Opposition) Superior Planet (Conjunction) Sun ](Exported%20image%2020240525203858-0.png)  

Eclipses at superior conjunction were late  
Eclipses at opposition were early
 
Time difference was ~17 minutes  
Speed = Distance/Time  
Speed of light ~= 2AU / 16.6 minutes
 
Ro/mer's observation was rudimentary bc he didn’t really know Earth's diameter.
 
Speed of light = C = 3x10^8 m/s

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
 
A wave is one of nature's ways of displacing energy   Parts of a Wave:

- Peak
- Amplitude
- Wavelength (lambda)
    
    - 1 period is the time it takes to move 1 wavelength
- Rest Position
- Trough
- Frequency = #cycles / sec
    
    - High frequency = shorter wavelength
 
Period = #sec / cycle  
Frequency = #cycle / sec
 
Period = 1 / frequency  
Frequency = 1 / Period
 
Speed = distance / time = lambda / T = **F(lambda) = V**

Diffraction is defined as the interference or bending of waves around the corners of an obstacle or through an aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle/aperture
 
The bending of waves around objects
 
WAVES CAN INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER

WAVES REFRACT THRU DIFFERENT MATERIALS

![Wave Refraction • When a wave enters a medium at an angle, refraction occurs because one side of the wave moves more slowly than the other side. Deep Water Shallow W a ter ](Exported%20image%2020240525203858-3.png) ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203858-4.png)

Refraction is why spoons look broken in water glasses
 
**Diffraction:** bending of waves thru openings or around obstacles  
**Refraction:** bending of waves due to change in wavespeed [medium – material thru which wave is moving
    
Wavelength for Sound Wave  
V = F(lambda)  
(lambda) - V / F = 345 m/s (~1000ft/s)
 
Counting time between a thunder flash + the sound: 5 sec ~= 1 mi
 
F = 263 cycles/sec = middle C on a piano  
V ~= 1.4m ~= 4 feet

DISPERSION – Wavelength dependent Refraction

Each wavelength bends a different amount
