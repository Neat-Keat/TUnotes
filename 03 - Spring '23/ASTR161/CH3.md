**MOTION OF ASTRONOMICAL BODIES**
 
**3.1 The Motions of Planets in the Sky**
 
**The Geocentric Model**
 
Ptolemy's Geocentric model
 
**Prograde Motion:** planets moving eastward  
**Retrograde Motion:** planets moving westward

This was the accepted paradigm for 1500 years
 
**Copernicus Proposes a Heliocentric Model**  
1st to develop a comprehensive mathematical model of heliocentrism  
Beginning of the Copernican Revolution  
Expanded on by Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton  
"On The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres" 1543
 
Planets further away from the sun than the earth have retrograde motion when the earth passes them  
Planets closer have retrograde motion when they pass the earth  
Magnitude drops w/ distance
 
**Scaling the Solar System**  
**Inferior:** planets closer to the sun than the earth  
**Superior:** planets further from the sun than the earth

**Kepler's Laws Describe Planetary Motion**
 
**Empirical Science:** describe patterns in nature with as much accuracy as possible
 
**Tycho Brahe's Observations**  
Created a geo-heliocentric system, where planets orbited the sun, which orbited Earth
 
**Kepler's Laws:**  
**1st Law:** The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one Focus  
**2nd Law:** the imaginary line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, regardless of where the planet is in its orbit  
**3rd Law:** P^2 = A^3
 
**3.3 Galileo's Observations Supported the Heliocentric Model**  
1st to use telescopes  
Discovered inertia but didnâ€™t claim it
 
**Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems**  
Catholic Church hated Galileo bc he supported the Copernican system  
Put on trial for heresy, sentenced to prison, placed under house arrest
 
**Newton's 3 Laws Help to Explain the Motion of Celestial Bodies**  
Newton invented calculus at 23
 
1st law: objects in motion stay in motion & vice versa  
2nd law: F = MA  
3rd: Equal + opposite reactions
