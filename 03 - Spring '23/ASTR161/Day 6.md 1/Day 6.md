Centripetal force ---> uniform circular motion  
F(c) = M(v^2/R)  
F(c) = M(4pi^2/T^2)R  
Gravitational Force  
F(gravity) = G(M(1)M(2))/R^2
 
Moon's Motion  
P(m) = 27.32 days  
360/27.32 = 13.18 degrees/day  
Earth's rotation  
360/24 = 15 degrees/**hour**
 
13.18/15 hr = 52 minutes  
If moon's directly overhead at noon today, itll be directly overhead at 12:52 tomorrow!
 
Tidal Forces

![sea level Water bulges away from Moon Water bulges toward Moon To Moon Equator Earth's rotation ](Exported%20image%2020240525203856-0.png)  

Happens because gravity pulls the close water away from the center  
Happens because gravity pulls the center away from the far water

Because the Earth rotates, the bulges rotate and actually sits just ahead of the moon (~10 degrees)  
High tide occurs ~40 minutes AFTER the moon is directly overhead
 
2 high tides and 2 low tides on a cycle of ~25 hours  
~12.5 hours between high tides/ low tides  
~6.25 hours between 2 tides
 
Similar to tidal bulges, the surface of the earth also has a very slight bulge (its not as flexible)
 
Does the Sun or Moon pull harder on the Earth?
 
Ratio of Sun's to Moon's Gravitational Pull on Earth  
F(se) = G(M(e)M(s)/R(es)^2)  
F(me) = G(M(e)M(m)/R(em)^2
 
F(se)/F(me) = M(s)/M(m) R(em)^2/R(es)^2  
= (2.7*10^7)(1/390)^2  
= 178  
The Sun exerts a force 178 times that of the moon on the Earth  
So why does the moon cause tides?
 
Differential Forces!  
Because the moon is much closer to the Earth than the sun, the force exerted on the critical areas **differs** much greater than the sun  
The DIFFERENCE in force across these areas is what causes tides
   

E ----------- m -------------------------------------------------S  
Causes very high high tides and very low low tides  
Called Spring Tides
 
m  
|  
|  
|  
E -----------------------------------------------------------------S
 
Causes lower high tides and higher low tides  
Called Neap Tides
   

The amount of time between a spring tide and a neap tide is about a week  
New and full moons causes spring tides  
1st and 3rd quarter moons cause neap tides!
 
Moon is moving away from us  
Earth is slowing down its rotation  
The tidal bulge gives the moon a slight forward force bc of the 10 deg, making it spiral slowly away from Earth  
Friction between the Earth and its Oceans gradually slows down the Earth's rotation, increasing the length of the day
 
Ch'ang-an Eclipse, 181 BCE  
If you were to calculate where the Earth would be for that eclipse with 24 hour days, then Ch'ang-an wouldn't have had an eclipse  
Ch'ang-an only works if the day is slightly longer
   

1.7/1,000,000 seconds added to a day each century  
By accounting for this discrepancy, the Ch'ang-an eclipse lines up
 
When the moon was molten, the core was pulled ever so slightly towards the earth  
This means that now, the moon's weight isnt distributed evenly  
If the moon's orbit were circular, it'd face the earth all the time
 
Because of the moon's elliptical orbit, it wobbles back and forth slightly relative to tidal forces  
The apparent size of the moon and the features we see change slightly through the month
 
There's moonquakes lmfao
 
We can see ~ 59% of the surface of the moon because of this wobble!
 
Roche Limit
   
![ROCHE LIMIT Outside the Roche limit the body is spherical Tidal Forces start to deform the body The body disintegrates A ring is formed as particles orbit at different times space fm ](Exported%20image%2020240525203856-2.png)  

Gravitational Cohesion is the force that pulls all parts of an object to its center, keeping it together
 
Disruptive forces are the difference in forces on a satellite based on the difference in distance and subsequent change in force from center planet
 
When Disruptive forces cancel gravitational cohesion, we get rings!
