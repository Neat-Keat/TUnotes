Europa – 2nd closest satellite to Jupiter  
Pressure from Jupiter suggests it has a liquid/slush ocean below the surface  
Europa has an induced magnetic field from Jupiter  
Implies Europa has some current carrying material  
Could be an ocean with salts in it :o
 
Mars may also be capable of hosting life  
Mars's atmosphere is much cooler than ours  
All their greenhouse gases were dissolved in a subsurface permafrost  
And distance lol  
Mars doesn't really have an atmosphere
 
Mars having water in the past is evidenced by  
Martian Gullies  
Salt Evaporite deposits  
Hematite concretions  
Flowing water on Mars  
Mud splashes
 
Mars – Viking Landers 1976-77  
Three main experiments
 
1) Gas Exchange Experiment  
Detect any processes that might be broadly considered as respiration. A surface sample was placed in a sealed container along with a controlled amount of gas and nutrients. The gases in the container were then monitored to see if their chemical composition changed
 
The composition changed, but the changes could be explained by chemistry. No hint of biology
 
2) Labeled Release Experiment  
Detect metabolic processes. A sample was moistened with nutrients containing radioactive carbon atoms. If any organisms in the sample consumed the nutrients, their waste products should include gases containing the telltale radioactive carbon.
 
Sterilized samples released less gas than unsterilized samples (suggesting biology), however a 2nd nutrient injection proved no additional gas (suggesting chemistry)
 
3) Pyrolytic-release experiment  
Detect photosynthesis. A surface sample was placed in a container along with radioactive carbon dioxide and exposed to artificial sunlight. If plantlike photosynthesis occurred, microorganisms in the sample would take in some of the radioactive carbon from the gas.
 
Some results were positive, some suggested none
 
Overall, all 3 results: ambiguous at best
 
Methane (CHy)
 
2 ways to produce  
1) biological  
Bacteria produce CHy  
This happens at the surface with atmospheric CO2  
Some of this carbon is radioactive C(14)
 
2) chemical  
Olivine + heat => CHy  
(mantle)  
This happens below surface  
C(14) is no longer present
 
UV + CHy => CH2 + H2  
This happens on Mars, but not Earth, because we have a protective layer of Ozone that stops UV radiation
 
We haven't been able to put a lander on Mars to prove if Mars's methane is biological or chemical
 
History of ALH84001

|   |   |
|---|---|
|4.5 BYA|Formed alongside Mars|
|16 MYA|Ejected from Mars (based on duration of cosmic ray exposure while in orbit)|
|13 KYA|Landed in Antarctica (Radiocarbon 14 dating of terrestrially acquired CO2)|
|1984|Discovered|
 
Note that the date of formation should put this event during the "wet" period in early Martian history
 
Martian meteorites ALH 84001 shows evidence of a wet environment  
...and possible fossils?  
Probably not lol, just some relic of unknown chemical reactions
 
LIFE BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM
 
Murchison Meteorite  
Found to have amino acids  
Quick review, amino acids can be right OR left handed  
Virtually all living tissue on Earth is made of LEFT handed amino acids  
The amino acids were a mix of right and left handed
 
Allende Meteorite showing chondrules  
It contained amino acids not known on Earth
 
Some molecules detected in the interstellar Medium

|---|---|
|Ethyl Alcohol|CH3CH2OH|
|Formaldehyde|H2CO|
|Methyl Cyanoacetylene|CH3C3N|
|Acetaldehyde|CH3CHO|
 
The Habitable Zone describes the temperature zone where liquid water can exist
 ![Of , 「 「 、 0 Sun ](03%20-%20Spring%20'23/ASTR161/Day%2024.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525203945-0.png)  

The problem with the habitable zone of really small stars is that the planets are usually tidally locked, like the moon with the Earth  
One side is extremely hot  
One side is extremely cold
 
The problem with the habitable zone of really large stars is that the star dies much faster
 
The Drake Equation  
N = (R)(Fp)(ne)(fl)(fi)(fe)L
 
N = # of tech advanced civs  
R = rate at which solar-type stars form  
Fp = fraction of stars that have planets  
Ne = # of planets per solar system that are earthlike  
Fl = fraction of those planets where life arises  
Fi = fraction of those life forms that develop intelligence  
Fe = fraction of those intelligent life forms that send messages into space  
L = # of years that tech advanced societies exist
