Chapter 3 - Motions of Astronomical Bodies  
Geocentric – Earth at the center of solar system  
Heliocentric – Sun at the center of solar system  
Retrograde motion is explained more simply by heliocentric model  
Don’t need deferents and epicycles!
 
Kepler's Laws  
Orbits are elliptical  
Equal area in equal time  
P^2 = A^3
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Galileo's Observations  
1st to make observations with a telescope  
Noticed the mountains of the moon, the moons of jupiter, the milky way, sunspots, and phases of Venus
 
1st telescope invented in 1608
 
The moon has mountains and valleys and looked mutable, as opposed to immutable  
This questioned ancient beliefs that the heavens were immutable
 
4 Galilean moons of Jupiter  
Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto  
"How do these moons go around Jupiter and not the Earth?"
 
The Milky Way (with a telescope!)  
There's so many stars :OO  
What we see is actually a cross-section of the galaxy
 
Sunspots:  
The sun changes :OOO what???
 
Phases of Venus  
Same phases of the Moon, just longer!  
Only observable with a telescope  
Soyjak Geocentric says that the line between Earth and Sun contains the center of the deferent of Mercury and Venus  
Chad Heliocentric says that’s how orbits work lmao

Galileo's Physics vs Aristotle's  
Aristotle: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, (Quintessence)  
Materials seek natural level  
Heavier objects fall faster  
Forced motion is un-natural
 
Galileo: no force required for constant motion  
All objects fall with the same acceleration
 
Galileo's law of inertia: objects keep their state of motion until acted on by an outside force  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
NEWTON!!!  
A generation after Galileo  
Invented Newtonian Mount for telescopes
 
LAWS OF MOTION:  
Velocity = rate of change of position with time  
Acceleration = rate of change of velocity with time  
Mass = intrinsic property of matter, measure of how hard it is to accelerate something (/= weight (force of gravity on an object))
 
1st law) objects in motion tend to stay in motion, in the same direction, until a net force acts upon it; an object at rest does the same
 
**2****nd** **law)** if a net force acts on an object, then the object's motion changes F = MA
 
3rd law) forces always come in pairs, and the forces of a pair are always equal in strength but opposite in direction
   

Mass = 50kg  
Force = 100 Newtons  
Acceleration = 2 m/s  
It will outrun you after 5 seconds
 
Acceleration of Gravity at Earth's Surface = 9.8 m/s^2 = g  
T = 1s, V = 9.8m/s  
T = 2s, V = 19.6m/s  
T = 3s, V = 29.4m/s
 
How did ancients observe the sun without going blind?

(Delta(position)) / (Delta(time)) = Velocity  
(Delta(velocity)) / (Delta(time)) = Acceleration

MKS SYSTEM
 
Length = meter  
Time = second  
Velocity = m/s  
Acceleration = m/(s^2)  
Mass = kilogram  
Force = Newton = (kg)(m/(s^2))
