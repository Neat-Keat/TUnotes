The Kuiper belt is a ring 20-50 AU away from the sun full of icy particles (in the ecliptic)  
The Oort Comet Cloud is a cloud ~100,000 AU away full of even more icy particles (spherical)
 
Comets from collisions within these areas where particles are knocked into orbit around the sun  
Kuiper belt comets usually have a period <200 years (called short period comets)  
Oort comet cloud comets usually have a much longer period (called long period comets) (10,000+ year periods)
 
Comet Halley is a short period comet  
History:  
Seen in Babylonian inscriptions from 164 BC  
Seen in the Bayeux Tapestry in 1066  
Seen by Kepler in 1607  
Seen by Halley (1656-1742) in 1682  
1687 – Newton's Principia was released  
1705 – predicted all 3 were the same comet, with a reappearance in late 1758  
1742 – Halley died  
Seen again in 1758 on Christmas day  
1835 – photography invented  
1910 – photography + spectroscopy reveals the comet contains cyanogen, a deadly poison. Earth went through the tail of the comet and everyone started panicking  
Our atmosphere is too thick and diluted it lol  
1986 – reappearance, Professor Krause saw it!  
2061 – next pass, perihelion at 7/28/2061
   

Period for Comet Halley  
K's 3rd law: T^2 = a^3  
A =  
Perihelion makes the comet .6 AU away from the sun  
Aphelion makes the comet 35.1 AU away from the sun  
Major axis is 35.7 AU  
Semimajor axis is 17.85 AU  
Period is sqrt((17.58)^3)  
Period = 75.4 years
 
So why does the period seem to vary?  
Jupiter and Saturn!  
They pull on the comet and change its orbit
 
“I came in with Halley’s Comet, It is coming again next year. The Almighty has said, no doubt, ‘Now there are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.’”  
-Mark Twain (born 1835)  
Died 4/21/1910, the day after perihelion
 
Giotto got photography of Comet Halley's tail in 1986  
They have a "nucleus", and a few tails

The comet drops dust, which follows the path of the comet and has a curved shape  
The comet also discharges ions bc of the sun's solar particles, resulting in an ion tail  
Ion tail ALWAYS points AWAY from the sun
 
Comet nuclei are "dirty snowballs"
 
Nucleus ~ 15 km  
Coma ~ 1,000,000 km  
Hydrogen envelope ~ 10,000,000 km  
Ion tail ~ 100,000,000 km (~ 1 AU lol)
 
Meteor showers come from the Earth passing through the tail of a comet, where the icy particles enter the atmosphere
 
Best time to view meteor showers is after midnight

C-type  
S-type  
M-type
   

Carbonaceous chondrites  
Why are these kinds of asteroids special?  
They contain materials which would be destroyed in a collision

- Water
- Amino acids
- Complex organic molecules

Very old, approaching 4.5 bn years old, same as solar system
 
The Allende meteorite is one such!

Zodiacal Light  
Light reflected from the dusty inner part of the solar system

The Tunguska Event of 1908  
Tunguska is in Siberia  
Random huge explosion felt hundreds of thousands of miles away tho  
Prolly an asteroid impact lol
