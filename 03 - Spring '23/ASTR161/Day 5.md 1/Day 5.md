T^2 = Ka^3  
For circles, a = r!!
 
K=1 if T=years, and A=AU
 
CENTRIPETAL FORCE  
Discovered by C. Huygens in 1659!  
A = dv/dt

A CIRCULAR ORBIT REQUIRES  
F=M(V^2/R) = (M(2piR/T)^2)/R = M(4pi^2/T^2)R
 
CENTRIPETAL  
V= (2piR/T)
 
Water Bucket demonstration
 
F(c) = M(4pi^2/T^2) R  
M= mass  
T= period  
R = radius
 
T^2 = KR^3
 
F(c) = M(4pi^2/(KR^3))R  
= (4pi^2/K)(M/R^2)

F = G (M1M2/R^2)
   

METRIC SYSTEM INFENTED BY THE FRENCH :vomit:  
Length: Meter (abt 39 inches, a little longer than a yard)  
Defined as 1/10,000,000 the distance from the North Pole to the Equator along the meridian running thru Paris  
Mass: gram (1/28 an ounce)  
The mass of 1 cubic centimeter of water. The Kilogram (1000 grams) is a more practical unit for most purposes  
Time: Second  
Defined as 1/86,400 of a day. An ancient definition, dating back to Roman Times  
Couldnâ€™t be accurately measured until the advent of pendulum clocks in the 1500s
   

THE TEST  
g= 9.8 m/s^2
 
The Gravity the moon experiences from the Earth =  
F(em) = M(m) ((4pi^2)/T(m)^2) Rm  
A(m) = F(em)/M(m) = 4pi^2/Tm^2)R(m) -----> KNOWN!!  
P(m) ~= 27 days  
D(m) = known
 
Law of Gravitation can predict the ratio of the gravitation of the Earth and of the Moon!  
A(m)/A(M) = g/((4pi^2)/(T(m)^2)R(mo) ------------> KNOWN
 
Ratio Predicted from Law of Gravitation  
F(grow) = G (M(E)M(object))/R^2  
A(m) = G(M(E)/R^2)  
Divided by  
A(M) = G(M(e)/R^2(mo))  
Equals  
R^2(mo)/R^2(E) WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE RATIO OF ACCELERATIONS

ORBITS  
Bound, unbound!
 
How fast for a satellite to have a skimming orbit?  
F = G(mM(E)/R^2(E) = m(V^2/R(E))  
V = sqrt(GM(E)/R(E)) ~ 7900 m/s ~ 17,700 mph
 
If you give a satellite more speed, it'll go from a circular orbit to an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit to a hyperbolic orbit
 
Circular (bound)  
Elliptical (bound)  
--------------------------------- Escape Speed = 11.3 km/s ~ 25,000 MPH  
Parabolic (unbound)  
Hyperbolic (unbound)

You can use eclipses to measure the distance to the moon!  
Aristarchus of Samos 310-230 BCE  
Diameter of the Earth = 3.667 Moon Diameter  
Earth Diameter is known, so too is the moons!
 
Similar Triangles  
Moon Distance/ Moon Diameter = Coin Distance/ Coin Diameter  
Moon Distance = Moon Diameter ( Coin Distance/ Coin Diameter)

M(E) = mass of the earth  
R(E) = Radius of the earth
