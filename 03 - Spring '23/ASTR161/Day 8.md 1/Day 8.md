"why are there gaps in the spectrum?"  
Bohr's atom answers this!

Allusion to planetary orbits
 
Circular motion (of electrons!) is accelerated motion  
Accelerated charges **RADIATE**  
Electromagnetic radiation
 
To make a stable atom, Bohr needed some weird assumptions:  
1) electron energy levels were fixed  
2) But electrons can make transitions between levels  
3) higher level = less stable  
4) putting energy into an atom causes it to get released as light  
Atoms produce light when there's a downward transition between levels

PHOTON THEORY OF LIGHT  
Comes from Einstein in 1905
 
-----------Red Light--------->  
(less energetic) (longer wavelength)
 
-----------Violet Light-------->  
(more energetic) (shorter wavelength)
 
Energy is carried by particles of pure energy called photons  
Energy in a beam of light is quantized  
(occurs in discrete amounts)
 
E(photon) = hf, where:  
H = Planck's Constant  
F = Frequency
 
Electromagnetic radiation  
F(lambda) = c  
Longer wavelengths need shorter frequencies than shorter wavelengths  
Red photons don’t carry as much energy as blue photons
 
Photons are massless  
Mass increases with velocity  
Photons exist only at the speed of light

H Alpha is the brightest color hydrogen gives off, which is what makes a lot in the universe look red

The Kirchhoff-Bunsen Classification of Spectra
 
Continuum Spectrum  
Hot gas Emission Line Spectrum  
Cold Gas Absorption Line Spectrum
   

Bohr atom analogous to planetary motion
 
Because electrons radiate energy, do planets?  
Yes! That’s where gravitational waves come from  
We're too small to have measurable ones, but they exist!
 
Predicted by Einstein & theory of relativity  
Proved 100 years later

TEMPERATURE SCALES

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||F|C|K|
|Boiling water|212|100|373|
|Freezing Water|32|0|273|
|Absolute Zero|-460|-273|0|
 
Because Temperature measures a molecule's motion, absolute 0 means that particles aren't moving at all.
 
Doppler Effect:  
A source moving toward or away from you will change its frequency and wavelength as measured by you.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
CAVITY RADIATION
 
For any object with a cavity that’s heated to a temperature T  
The material between the inside and outside gets filled with radiation  
With a small hole, you can analyze the color of the radiation escaping  
Chart brightness against wavelength  
The distribution varies with temperature

Higher temperature moves the peak into shorter wavelengths and brightens everywhere
