Convection Currents in the upper mantle
 ![Asthenosphere Subduction zone Continental crust Spreading zone Convection Oceanic crust Lower portion of lithosphere Subduction Volcano Rising magma ](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-0.png)

At a rift (spreading zone) between separating plates, lava oozes upward and forms new crust  
At a subduction zone, one plate pushes the other down into the mantle  
Where plates collide, deep oceanic trenches and mountain ranges are formed
 
Evidence of Tectonic Processes found in cross sections of hills and mountains
 
Seafloor Spreading

The percent of iron in the ground aligned is a good indicator of the strength of the Earth's magnetic field at the time

Mars has a giant gash in it
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-3.png)  

No evidence that this is due to tectonism
   

2 Basic types of volcanos
 
Composites, like Mt. Fujiyama

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-4.png) ![Subductingplate Oceanic cr 1 Trench e;ntinentai VO 一 03n0 erridi ](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-5.png)

This means that a lot of the volcanos in the Ring of Fire are also composites
   

Shield Volcanos, like Mauna Loa

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-6.png)  

Shield volcanos have much shallower inclines  
They imply the idea of hot spot volcanism

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-7.png)  

As a plate moves over a "hot spot", aka a weak spot of the crust, a chain of volcanos are made   The island furthest from the hot spot is the oldest
   

Switching gears, Mars has Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system  
About the size of Arizona, and 2x the height of Mt. Everest  
Dormant for a few billion years  
Example of hot spot volcanism. BUT! Because it's not part of a chain, this implies that Mars does NOT have tectonic plates
 
Similar thing on Venus too lol
 
CHAPTER 9!!  
Atmospheres of the Terrestrial Planets
 
Gases in a protoplanetary disk, mostly hydrogens and heliums were captured by young planets, forming _primary atmospheres._
 
Sunlight heated the atmospheres. Rapid thermal motion of light atoms and molecules caused the primary atmospheres to escape.
 
Volcanoes released gases
 
And impacting comets and asteroids contributed water and other molecules to form _secondary atmospheres_
 
Larger planets' gravity could retain an atmosphere:  
Venus  
Earth  
Mars
 
Smaller planets' gravity could not retain an atmosphere:  
Mercury  
Earth's Moon
   
![1올」 눔춮은}; ](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-8.png)  

￼Escape speed is due to mass and size of a planet  
Speed distribution is due to mass of molecules and temperature

![丆 = 0 K 丆 300 K 0 0 200 1000 1200 Speed (m/s) ](Exported%20image%2020240525203917-9.png)

Any molecules that are moving faster than the escape speed of a planet escape that planet's atmosphere  
This leads to a redistribution of molecule speeds, where some particles speed up past the escape speed again  
Positive feedback loop causes smaller planets to lose their atmosphere
 
Larger planets with higher escape speeds don’t allow more particles to leave, so if they are losing their atmosphere, its much slower than smaller planets
 
**TL;DR**  
**Large, cold planets retain atmospheres**  
**Small, hot planets lose atmospheres**
 
Earth's water  
From comets?  
Probably not!  
How?  
Water is H2O  
But! The hydrogen can have different isotopes!  
H(1)(1) is normal hydrogen  
H(2)(1) is "heavy" hydrogen (deuterium)  
H(3)(1) exists, but is NOT stable
 
Earth's ratio of H(1)(1) to H(2)(1) does NOT match comet's isotopic ratio!  
So where?  
Ceres has cryovolcanoes, which spew out frozen brine material, including water!  
Spectroscopic analysis indicates that the isotopic ratio is much closer
 
This means that water from asteroids is more likely!
    
The Greenhouse Effect!
 
Consider an Earth with no atmosphere:  
The Sun sends radiation to the Earth, the Earth returns sum to maintain an equilibrium  
(The Earth radiates ~39% of all radiation sent to it, the rest is absorbed)  
This is the Earth's Albedo  
Earth = 39%  
Moon = 11%  
Venus = 59%
 
Albedo measures the amount of radiation an object reflects
 
Earth has to be heated to a point of equilibrium because of the Blackbody Radiation curve  
Earth's temp for equilibrium WITHOUT an atmosphere = 246K = -27C = -17F  
This would mean no liquid water  
This would mean no life!
 
Now consider an Earth WITH an atmosphere:  
Temp for equilibrium now needs to follow Wien's Displacement Law  
Lambda(peak) = .029/T = 13,900nm when T=246K, which is in the infrared  
This does NOT penetrate the atmosphere very well
 
Infrared Radiation ( emitted at 246K)  
Does not penetrate our atmosphere well
 
Nitrogen and Oxygen in our atmosphere are diatomic molecules (2 atoms make a molecule)  
They have 2 axes of rotation
 
CO2, H2O, NH3, CH4, Methane, etc. are polyatomic, so they have 3 axes of rotation  
They lose energy faster, so they are considered greenhouse gases  
They mostly get absorbed by the atmosphere and reradiated back onto the Earth.
 
More greenhouse gases in that atmosphere mean an increase in Earth's temperature to reach equilibrium
 
Must have higher temp so can lose some on the way out and still balance incoming radiation
 
T = 288k = 59F  
LIQUID WATER!!  
LIFE!!!
