Chapter 3 – Motions of Astronomical Bodies
 
Early Babylonian Universe
 
The nested Spheres of Eudoxus, the motion of the sun  
The theory of homocentric spheres: the solar theory

- Outer sphere revolves every 24 hours
- 2nd sphere revolves once a year
- 3rd sphere to which sun is affixed revolves once a year
 
The Harmonic Series was discovered by the Pythagoreans, and thrown on top of Astronomy

- Idea behind the music of the spheres
 
We knew the earth was round bc of the shadow of the Earth on the moon during eclipses
 
Plato + Aristotle contributed to geocentric ideas:  
"Earth does not move"  
If the earth moves, then the angle between the earth and the stars in the celestial sphere would change  
They actually do! It's called Parallax!!  
On the scale of the stars, it's pretty hard to notice with the naked eye  
Objects closer appear to move faster than objects further away  
Parallax wasn’t measured till the 1800s

Retrograde Motion:
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203849-0.png)     

Planets appearing to move westward is Prograde Motion (normal)  
Planets appearing to move eastward is Retrograde Motion (abnormal)

EPICYCLES AND DEFERENTS

![Epicycle Center of Epicycle o Equant Earth Deferent Center of epicycle moves counter- clockwise on deferent and epicycle moves counterclockwisa Epicycle speed is uniform with respect to equant The combined motion is shown at right o Earth Equant Deferent motion is in direction of point I to 7 but planet's epicycle carries it on cycloid path (points I through 7) so that from points 3 through s the planet moves backward (retrograde) ](Exported%20image%2020240525203849-2.png)

Kepler  
Tycho Brahe  
Owned an island abt a generation before telescopes  
Kept detailed records of basically everything he could see in the night sky for over a decade  
Especially Mars  
Observed a nova in 1572!!  
Observed a comet in 1577!!  
Passed all his data on to Kepler when he died
 
Kepler was a mathematician first  
Phenomenological Approach to Tycho's data  
Came up with 3 laws of planetary motion (they're still in use today!)
 
Kepler's First Law:  
Planetary orbits are elliptical, not circular, with the Sun at one focus point
 
Kepler's Second Law:  
Equal areas in equal times  
Based on the conservation of angular momentum, which Kepler knew nothing about
 
Kepler's Third Law:  
T= period (years)  
A = semimajor axis (AU)  
T^2 = a^3 for all objects in Gravitational Orbit around the sun
 
Mars:  
T = 1.88 years  
T^2 = 3.53 = a^3  
A = (3.53)^(1/3)  
A = 1.52 AU
 
![Minor axis Major axis ](Exported%20image%2020240525203849-4.png)  

Major axis is the entire horizontal diameter  
Semimajor axis is half the horizontal diameter
 
Minor axis is the entire vertical diameter  
Semiminor axis is half the vertical distance

![Slower Blue areas equal Faster ](Exported%20image%2020240525203849-5.png)  

1 AU = the average distance between the Earth and the Sun
