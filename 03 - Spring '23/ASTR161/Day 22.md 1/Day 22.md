The sun appears yellow on Earth because the atmosphere scatters it's light
 
The sun is ~100 Earth Diameters across  
Volume ~1,000,000 Earth Volumes
 
Stars exist in a battle between gravity trying to compress and nuclear reactions trying to expand  
Main sequences are stable, but when they run out of fuel, they expand to the size of a red giant
 
Hydrostatic equilibrium

THERMAL RADIATION  
Most efficient way for energy to travel out from the core is thru radiation  
Why?  
The interior is so hot that collisions between atoms rips them of their electrons (they move so fast bc its so hot)
 
Atoms are totally ionized, making photons free to escape
 
However, after leaving the "radiation zone", its cold enough that there's enough un-ionized atoms to block most radiation
 
Makes carrying energy by radiation less efficient than convection
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203942-2.png)  

Convective zone has convection cells that carry energy to the surface of the sun in a similar way to convection cells in our atmosphere
 
The surface is defined by when the convection zone doesn't have enough material to keep going
 
This means that energy can radiate again!  
This area (ie the surface, is called the photosphere)
 
Relevant summarizing graphs on BB
 
Center of the sun is 16,000,000K  
Surface of the sun is ~5800K
 
The core of the sun is much denser than the surface
 
Luminosity of the sun = 4*10^26 watts
 
Hydrogen -> Helium + Energy
 
REMINDER FOR NUCLEAR SYMBOLS
 
Chem Symbol (Protons) (Protons + Neutrons)  
H(1)(1)  
U(92)(235)
 
Isotopes have atypical amounts of neutrons, like  
H(1)(3)  
U(92)(238)
   

Beta decay is electron decay
 
BETA DECAY
 
n- > (p+) + (e-) + (neutrino)  
Can happen on its own and implies that neutrons by themselves are unstable
 
(p+) -> n + (e+) + (neutrino)  
CANT happen on its own, needs to be forced to happen
 ![Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion fusbn 0-235 U-236 Ba.144 ](Exported%20image%2020240525203942-3.png)  

Implies that larger molecules can become smaller and then stabilize  
Implies that smaller molecules can become larger and then stabilize  
Implies that there should be an equilibrium
 
Fission happens in nuclear power plants  
Fusion happens in the sun
 
We cant do fusion bc it needs egregiously large temperatures, even though its more stable and efficient
   

PROTON-PROTON CHAIN

![Gamma ray V ](Exported%20image%2020240525203942-4.png)  

4H(1)(1) ---> He(2)(4) + 2(e+) + 2(gamma rays)
   

SOLAR INTERIOR
 
Heres the photosphere:

Rice pattern due to all the convection currents  
But it vibrates!!

Solar neutrino problem:  
The proton-proton chain shows that 2 neutrinos are ejected,  
If we can measure the # of neutrinos the sun emits, we can double check everything  
V hard to measure, photons pass thru sensors lmfao
 
But Ray Davis did it in 1970 and only found 1/3 of what was expected  
Then in the 1980's Japan made the Kamiokande Dectector which confirmed this observation
 
This was found to be because of Neutrino Oscillations  
Neutrinos oscillate  
The sun produces electron neutrinos, but they oscillate evenly into muon and tau neutrinos, so we could only measure the 1/3 electron neutrinos
