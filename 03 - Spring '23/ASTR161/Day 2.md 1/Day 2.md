Precession: a change in the orientation of the Earth's rotation axis  
Takes about 26,000 years  
Causes a change in the Pole Star (rn its polaris)  
Causes a change in seasons  
Also called the Precession of the Seasons
 
Moon Phases
 
Eclipses  
Solar Eclipses, where the moon covers the Sun  
Lunar Eclipse, where the Earth covers the Moon  
We DONT have solar and lunar eclipses every month bc of the line of nodes  
Bailey's Beads – see right (that’s the surface of the moon!)

Procession

![to Vega (North Star in the year 14,000) 231/20 Earth's axis of rotation to Polaris (North Star now) Precession: every 26,000 years Earth's axis of rotation completes a circle. Approximately 12,000 years from now, Earth's axis of rotation will line up with the star Vega. plane of Earth's orbit around sun O Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. ](Exported%20image%2020240525203848-0.png)

This effect is caused by the pull of the moon!  
The moon rotates about 5 degrees off of the ecliptic  
This change + tidal forces = procession
 
NO SOUTH STAR, ONLY NORTH  
The SH learned to navigate based off of galaxies and other semi-constant figures
 
The change in tilt causes the seasons to very gradually change over the 26,000 year period  
The tilt rotates to the west while the earth rotates to the east  
Every 6500 years (¼ procession period) spring becomes summer, summer becomes fall, fall becomes winter, and winter becomes spring  
Dates still won't change, so spring is in august lol  
Called the procession of the equinox bc the equinox days don’t change
 
In ancient times, spring equinox = end of winter, you've survived, you can plant again  
Aries is the 1st zodiac sign bc it started spring 4000 years ago.  
Pisces is the 2nd, it started spring 2000 years ago  
Pisces is a fish, and that’s why a fish is an important symbol in the church :0
 
Procession affects climate, not weather
 
Rn distance to sun counteracts seasons, but not in 13000 years, itll magnify them!
 
A procession period of 1 year means year-round summer, etc.

Moon Phases
 ![waxing gibbous full moon waning gibbous first quarter h last quarter waxing crescent new moon waning crescent ](Exported%20image%2020240525203848-1.png)

½ of the moon is ALWAYS illuminated, the other half is dark!
 
Moon phases depend on what part of the illuminated side we see from earth
 
New > waxing crescent > first qtr > waxing gibbous > full > waning gibbous > last qtr > waning crescent
 
Gibbous means swollen LMFAO
 
Terminator line: Line that seperates the light and dark side of the moon ( it moves over time) (Right to LEFT)
 
1 cycle = 1 month  
1 quarter cycle = 1 week

ECLIPSES:
 
Solar Eclipses
 ![MOON Umbra Penumbra ](Exported%20image%2020240525203848-2.png)  

The moon is too small, so there's only a 60 mile wide circular shadow that travels along an eclipse path
 
Umbra is the darkest part  
Penumbra is the darker part  
Total eclipse in the umbra,  
Partial eclipse in the penumbra
 
Earth is very gradually slowing down it's rotation bc of the moon
 
Annular eclipse is where the moon doesn't fit the sun completely bc its orbit is closer to the sun
 
Lunar Eclipses
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203848-3.png)  

You can see any lunar eclipse you're in the dark side of the earth (if its night!)
 
Why don’t we get both types of eclipse once a month?
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203848-4.png)

The moon's orbit is ~5 deg off of the ecliptic. The Line where the ecliptic and where the moon's orbit meet up is called the Line of Nodes
 
Eclipses CAN occur when the Earth, Moon, AND Sun are ALL on the line of nodes
 
If the moon's orbit DIDNT have a 5 degree tilt, we'd have an eclipse of each type each month
 
Time between eclipses is random, but averages ~5 of either type per year
 
SOLAR ECLIPSES NEED A NEW MOON  
LUNAR ECLIPSES NEED A FULL MOON
    
BAILEY's BEADS
 
The surface of the moon isnt perfectly smooth  
During a solar eclipse, light shines thru the valleys of the moon  
These lights are called bailey's beads
