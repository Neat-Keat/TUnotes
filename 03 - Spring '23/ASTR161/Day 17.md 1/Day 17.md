Bc Uranus spins on its side, its rings do too!!
 
Regular satellites have:

- Generally equatorial orbits
- Prograde direction
- Considered to be naturally formed alongside the planet
 
Irregular satellites have:

- Generally non-equatorial orbits
- Often retrograde orbits
- Considered to be captured asteroids
    
    - Except triton??
 
Saturn's Hyperion  
Honeycomb structure  
Lightweight  
Tumbles
 
Saturn's Iapetus  
Equatorial ridge 4000km above it
 
Europa  
Liquid water under the surface of Europa?  
Evidence in structures of water flow and particles trapped underground  
AND an inducted magnetic field  
Needs Rapid rotation and current carrying material to be a natural magnet  
Europa does NOT have rapid rotation  
But it does have a magnetic field?  
Is Jupiter inducing magnetism in it? Yeah prolly  
This means that Europa contains a current carrying material  
We think it's water with dissolved salts
 
Differentiation of the Galilean Moons  
Io  
Molten mantle  
Rocky crust  
Iron core  
Ganymede  
Icy crust  
Icy mantle (and ocean?)  
Rocky mantle  
Europa  
Rocky mantle  
Ocean  
Icy crust  
Iron core  
Callisto  
Icy crust  
Ocean?  
Mixed ice-rock interior
 
Scattering

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203922-1.png)   
Wavelength independent scattering  
White light in -> white light out everywhere  
Why our clouds are white!
 
Wavelength dependent scattering  
White light in -> specific wavelengths out  
Like prisms!
 
But what causes this phenomenon to discriminate?  
The size of the particles!  
WLI has large particles, while WLD has small particles  
"large" and "small" relative to the wavelengths coming in
 
Direct sunlight is yellow, it's scattered in the atmosphere to appear blue

![В1ие scattered „Яда арреатз ved(lish Sun пеаг Sun пе • Ыие scattered Obscrver ](Exported%20image%2020240525203922-2.png)  

Full moon illusion makes the sun look bigger closer to the horizon
 
TITAN!!!!
 
Titan is the largest satellite of Saturn  
You can't see its surface?  
It's atmosphere is that dense?  
Ya, its mostly methane
 
Cassini Spacecraft  
Visible light doesn't penetrate, but Ultraviolet and Infrared kind of do  
With some atmospheric scattering ofc  
There's some cratering, but not much!  
Its geologically active!!  
Signs of liquid  
Lakes too??  
Titan ~ 95K, so the liquid could be methane  
Cassini dropped the Huygens Probe onto the surface for a soft landing!  
Furthest we've ever landed
