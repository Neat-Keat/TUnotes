Parallax works with anything you can see and that’s not infinitely far away
 
Barnards star is very close to us, so it appears to move over time much more than others bc of parallax
 
Parallax is an apparent motion

Parallax angle = α  
Distance = 1/α, measured in parsecs  
1 degree = 60 arcminutes  
1 arcminute = 60 arcseconds  
1 arcsecond = 1/3600 degrees
 
The closest star beyond the sun, Proxima Centauri  
α = .77 arcsec  
1 parsec = 1/α when a = 1  
1 parsec = 3.26 ly
 
D(alpha centauri)= 1/.77 = 1.3 pc = 4.XX ly
 
Measuring α  
From Earth, we have precision to measure  
α --> 0.01 arcseconds  
Which means  
d--> 100 parsecs ~= 326 ly (not a lot of stars)  
From Hipparchos satellite (1990)  
α --> .001 arcsec  
d= 1000pc (120,000 stars) (volume increases by the cube!)  
From Gaia satellite  
α --> 24/1,000,000 arcsec  
D = (1,000,000,00 stars)
 
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW D = 1/α!!!!!!

1-2 = 2-4 = 4-8 = 8-16 for _perceived_ steps in intensity  
1-3 = 3-9 = 9-27
 
think of a musical scale

Middle C (264hz) (528) (1056) (2112)
 
Each of these intervals is an octave, but each octave has 2x the range as the one before it
 
_Magnitude Scale_

Magnitude 1 has 100x the energy compared to 6  
Energy ratio between any 2 adjacent magnitudes = (100)^1/5 - 10 ^(2/5) = 2.512  
5th mag star is brighter than 6th mag star by factor of 2.521  
4th mag star is brighter than 6th mag star by factor of 2.521^2
 
2 different magnitudes  
m= apparent magnitude = viewed from Earth  
M = absolute magnitude = magnitude a star would have if it were 10 pc away
 
Derivation of Distance Modulus  
A star gives off light at a certain Luminosity, L  
At a distance D of 10 pc, a measurer observes M and bM  
We exist at d relative to the star, and measure m and bm
 
bM = L/4(pi)D^2  
Bm = L/4(pi)d^2
 
BM/bm = (L/p(pi)D^2)/(L/4(pi)d^2) = (d/D)^2 = 10^(2/5)^(m-M) = 2.512^m-M  
= 10^(2(m-M/5))
 
Implies d/D = 10^(m-M/5)  
Implies d = 10^(m-M/5 +1) for a distance D of 10 pc
 
SOLVEABLE WITH BOTH m AND M GIVEN
