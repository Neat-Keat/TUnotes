TNO  
Trans Neptunian Objects  
Objects past Neptune's orbit
 
OORT cloud is spherical, possible leftover from when the solar system was formed?

REQUIREMENTS TO BE A PLANET  
1) Direct orbit around the Sun (or another star)  
2) Mostly Spherical shape  
3) Clears its Orbit (as it orbits a star, it picks up all the debris in the way)

A "Kuiper Belt" around another Star exists lol  
The Henry Draper catalog
 
Lowell Observatory  
Flagstaff, Arizona  
Opened 1894  
24" refractor
   

An Italian saw canals on Mars in 1870s, called them Canalli  
In Italian, this means natural waterways  
Misinterpreted as artificial canals, implying extraterrestrial life
 
The War of the Worlds  
Book from 1898  
Adapted to a radio broadcast in 1938  
So realistic people thought it was real
 
Using modern tech, we know that Mars has channels, but not canals
   

New Horizons spacecraft imaged Pluto

Active surface? Weird for such a cold, small rock  
Water ice detected  
Has moons, means we can find its mass, and therefore density

Charon and Pluto are both locked to each other

The dark spot on the left is called Mordor lmfao

Ceres is both an asteroid and a dwarf planet
 
Dawn is an ion-drive spacecraft, meaning it saves on fuel!  
Went to ceres  
It has bright spots!  
It has mountains!
 
The apollo asteroids are within the orbit of Mars, meaning that they can collide with Earth
 
Kirkwood Gaps in Asteroid Belt  
Most asteroids are in orbit between Jupiter and Mars  
Asteroids with ½ or 1/3 or whatever period relative to Jupiter, get pulled out of their orbits  
Resonances!
 
There's a really cool graph that I can't find that's probably in the textbook
   

Trojan Asteroids  
Asteroids in special orbits caused by gravitational interactions between the sun, Jupiter, and the asteroid

![L3 L5Tro 」 anAst Trojan 、 5 一 ero L2 ](Exported%20image%2020240525203925-7.png)  

L1 acts as though it is farther out from Sun where it has longer period  
Called a Lagrange point  
Theres 5!  
L1-L5  
These are the valid locations for trojan asteroids
 !["T-ojan Ma upiter : "Greeks" ](Exported%20image%2020240525203925-8.png)  

This phenomenon happens for any 2 body system  
We park telescopes in these Lagrange positions
