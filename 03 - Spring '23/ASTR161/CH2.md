Patterns in the Sky - Motions of Earth and the Moon
 
**2.1 Earth Spins on its Axis**  
Ancient people could predict seasons and rain by studying the sun, moon, and stars
 
**The Celestial Sphere**  
Earth's rotation on its axis determines the passage of day and night, dictating the rhythm of life on Earth  
Ancients thought the Earth was stationary bc they couldn't perceive its motion
 
**Looking down on the North Pole, the Earth rotates counter-clockwise once per 24 hours**  
People are taken west to east, stars and planets appear to move east to west  
**Apparent Daily Motion:** the path each object takes across the sky as seen from Earth's surface
 
**Celestial Sphere:** image the sky as a sphere having stars painted on its surface w/ Earth centered  
Imaginary!!!  
**NCP:** North Celestial Pole, directly above North pole  
**SCP:** South Celestial Pole, directly above South pole  
**Celestial Equator:** Directly above Equator, divides sky into north and south halfs  
**Latitude:** indication of distance N/S of the Earth's Equator, even in space  
**Declination:** distance N/S of Celestial equator (0 to +-90)  
**Longitude:** distance E/W from Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England  
**Right Ascension:** measures angular distance of a celestial body eastward along the celestial equator from the point where the Sun's path crosses the celestial equator from S/N  
**Ecliptic:** path of the Sun in the sky throughout the year  
**Zenith:** point in the sky directly above wherever you are  
**Meridian:** imaginary north-south line dividing the sky into an E/W half. Runs from N horizon thru Zenith to S horizon  
**Nadir:** point directly below you (opposite of Zenith?)
 
**The View From the Poles**  
At Poles, the zenith always points to the same stars, so nothing rises or sets  
NCP sees one half of the sky and stars rotate counterclockwise  
SCP sees the other half of the sky and stars rotate clockwise
 
**The view away from the poles**  
Latitude determines what part of the sky you see throughout the year  
Angle between your horizon and the NCP = your latitude everywhere on Earth
 
**Circumpolar:** stars closer to the NCP than your latitude never dip below the horizon  
There's also a region of SH stars that never rise in the NH  
Anything in-between is only visible for part of each day  
Only place to see the ENTIRE night sky in 24 hours is the equator
 
NCP: stars only circle, never rising or setting, SH stars never visible  
Equator: stars rise and fall straight up  
SCP: same as NCP  
Anywhere else:  
Star on celestial equator rises due east and sets due west  
Star N of CE rise N of E and set N of W  
Star S of CE rise S of E and set S of W
 
Anywhere that's not a pole sees any object on the celestial equator for 12 hours a day
 
NH has Polaris for NCP  
SH has the constellation Crux for SCP
 
Identifying a pole star lets you derive N/S, therefore E, W, and latitude  
Not longitude bc of Earth's rotation
 
**THE MOTION OF AN OBJECT DEPENDS ON THE FRAME OF REFERENCE OF THE OBSERVER**
 
The equator rotates faster than the poles (see right)  
Objects thrown towards the equator curve west  
Objects thrown away from the equator curve east (see right)  
CORIOLIS EFFECT
 
Strong enough to deflect fly balls in the N US by 1/2 cm
   

**2.2 Revolution about the Sun Leads to Changes during the Year**  
Earth revolves around the sun AND spins around its axis counterclockwise  
1 year = 1 revolution  
Causes seasons + a change in stars in the night sky
 
Stars overhead at noon now are overhead at midnight 6 months from now
 
Modern NH constellations draw from Ptolemy's list from 2000 years ago  
Modern SH constellations draw from EU explorers in 17th + 18th century
 
Today, theres an officially sanctioned set of 88
 
Brightest star in a constellation is alpha  
2nd is beta, etc
 
The 13 constellations that lie along the ecliptic are the zodiac
 
**The Tilt of Earth's Axis and the Seasons**  
Without the 23.5 deg tilt, all days would be 12 hours and there would be no seasons, a big part is bc light is less concentrated (see right)
 
**The Solstices and the Equinoxes**  
The day when the sun is highest in the sky crossing the meridian is the Summer Solstice  
June 20th, longest day of the year, start of summer in NH, days get shorter  
The day when the sun is lowest in the sky crossing the meridian is the Winter Solstice  
Dec 21st, shortest day of the year, start of winter in NH, days get longer
 
Autumnal Equinox = 12 hrs of light + dark, start of Fall in NH  
Sept 22  
Vernal Equinox = 12 hrs of light + dark, start of Spring in NH  
Mar 20
 
Polar seasons are weird  
N of 66.5N and south of 66.5S, the sun is circumpolar around the  
first day of summer  
These areas are the arctic and antarctic circles  
The opposite is true, with days of no sun around the winter solstice
 
Days and nights on the equator are always 12 hours long throughout the year
 
Living between the tropic of cancer and capricorn means the 2x a year the sun will be directly overhead at noon
 
**Precession of the Equinoxes**  
Once every 26,000 years, the tilt of the earth's axis completes a revolution  
Shifts seasons and equinox dates and the North Star!
 
**2.3 The Moon's Appearance Changes as it Orbits Earth**
 
**The Changing Phases of the Moon**
 
**Sidereal period:** how long it takes to return to the same location in its orbit (27.32 days)  
**Synodic period:** length between 2 full moons bc of Earth's orbit (29.53 days) (1 month!)
 
The moon has a **synchronous rotation** between its revolution and rotation  
We only see 1 face of the moon
 
**2.4 Calendars are Based on the Day, Month, and Year**  
Egyptians used system of 12 months, 30 days each, with 5 festival days and leap months when necessary  
Babylonians started 24 hr day + 7 day week ( 1 for sun, 1 for moon, 5 for visible planets)  
1st lunisolar calendar  
Month began with the first sighting of the lunar crescent, + leap months  
Discovered that 235 lunar months = 19 solar years  
Created a calendar cycle with 12 12 month years and 7 13 month years  
Chinese used a 365.25 day year by 500BCE  
Some cultures used stellar calendars, following the position of stars  
Islamic calendar is purely lunar, with no 13th lunar month, holidays drift earlier each solar year
 
Today, we use The Gregorian Calendar, based on the Tropical year  
This measures the 365.242 solar days from one vernal equinox to the next
 
**Solar day:** 24 hr period of Earth's rotation that brings the sun back to the same local meridian
 
**Sidereal day:** time it takes for Earth to make 1 rotation and face the exact same star on the meridian (23 hrs 56 min) (differs bc of Earth's motion around the sun)
 
Gregorian Calendar uses a system of leap years
 
Named for Pope Gregory XIII
 
Slips 1 day every 20,000 years
 
**2.5 Eclipses Result from the Alignment of Earth, Moon, and the Sun**
 
**Eclipse:** total or partial obscuration of one celestial body, or the light from that body, by another celestial body
 
Stonehenge may have predicted eclipses?

"Among all solar eclipses, one-third are total at some location on the surface of Earth, one-third are annular, and one-third are seen only as a partial eclipse."
 
A total solar eclipse can NEVER last longer than 7.5 minutes and is usually significantly shorter
   
![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203850-1.png)  

Total lunar eclipses can last up to 1hr 40min  
"This “blood-red Moon,” as it has been called in literature and poetry, occurs because the Moon is being illuminated by red light from the Sun that is bent as it travels through Earth’s atmosphere and hits the Moon. Other colors of light are absorbed or scattered away from the Moon by Earth’s atmosphere and therefore do not illuminate it.**"**

The Moon's orbit is inclined by about 5.2 deg relative to the Earth's orbit around the Sun
 
**Line of Nodes:** line along which the orbital plane of the Sun AND Moon intersect  
For part of the year, the line of nodes points in the general direction of the sun  
This is called an **eclipse season**  
Only lasts 38 days
