The moon has a similar size to mercury, and a similar density to Mars, so we include it
 
7 Large moons in the solar system
 
Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto around Jupiter  
Titan around Saturn (it has a hydrologic cycle! And we've landed on it!)  
Triton around Neptune (weird orbit patterns!)  
Earth's Moon!

Impacts
 
Meteoroids – in orbit  
Meteor – flash in the atmosphere  
Meteorite – remnant landing on Earth
 
Sizes:
 
Micrometeoroid – up to 10 microns (1/1,000,000m) (human blood cell = ~5 microns)  
Generally burn up in the atmosphere  
Meteoroid – up to 1 m  
Asteroid – anything larger

Craters often have central peaks because the impact heats up the surface so much it almost behaves like a liquid
 
Ejecta can be large enough to cause smaller, secondary craters
 
Shadows in craters can let us estimate the depth of a crater
 
Because mercury has stronger gravity than the moon, it's craters have smaller ejecta blankets
 
Impact quartz only found at crater impacts

Cenozoic Era from 65MYA to Present "new life"  
Mesozoic Era before 65MYA "middle life"  
Has lots of soot and 50% of expected fossils  
Implies one of our 6 mass extinctions

How did the Moon form?
 
Theories:  
1) formed alongside Earth  
No bc diff compositions  
2) captured  
No bc difficult physics  
3) Ejection  
Earth spun so fast when it first formed that the moon was ejected from a superfast, molten earth  
No bc idea of tectonics  
4) impact theory  
Yes bc only one left
 
Evidence:  
Compositions of Earth + Moon are Different  
Moon's density is ~= density of Earth's mantle

 Venus's surface gets remade, just like Earths!  
Mostly thru volcanos tho, no evidence of tectonics
