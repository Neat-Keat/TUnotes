Magnitude: Perceived Intensity  
Mag 1 is bright  
Mag 6 is dim
 
These 5 steps = factor of 100 in brightness  
Each step = ratio of 100^(1/5) or 10^(2/5) or ~2.512
 
m = apparent magnitude  
M = absolute magnitude (10 pc away)
 
a star gives out a certain luminosity L  
L at D (10pc) = M  
b(M) = L/(4(pi)D^2)
 
L at d = m  
b(m) = L/(4(pi)d^2)
 
b(M)/b(m) = (d/D)^2 = (10^(2/5))^(m-M)
 
d = 10*10^(m-M/5) = 10^((m-M)/(5) +1)
 
Suppose a star is so distant that its apparent magnitude is greater by 5 than its absolute magnitude (m-M = 5). How far away is it?  
d = 10^((5/5)+1)  
d = 10^2  
d = 100 pc
 
Deneb is a supergiant star in the northern cross. It has an apparent magnitude of 1.25 and an absolute magnitude of –8.75. How far away is it?  
d = 10^(((1.25)-(-8.75)/5)+1)  
d = 10^((10/5)+1)  
d = 10^3  
d = 1000 pc
 
revisit blackbody radiation  
T = constant/lambda(peak)  
hotter objects shine brighter and with shorter wavelengths
 
Henry Draper Catalog (1890's)  
Draper went to Harvard's observatory and just made a giant catalog of all the stars his employees could find  
also he hired only women in 1930 which is based  
catalog is sorted based on the strength of each emission's hydrogen line  
sorted alphabetically  
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K…  
strong weak
 
Cannon came in and said that’s stupid, she changed it to be sorted based on temperature  
O, B, A, F, G, K, M  
hot cooler
 
each letter has subgroups 0 through 9  
(I.e. B0, B1, B2, B3, etc.

a star has a luminosity L  
L = flux * area = ((constant)T^4)* (4(pi)R^2)  
Stefan-Boltzmann Law = (constant) T^4  
area = (4 pi R^2)
 
are L and T correlated?

Hertzsprung Diagrams for cluster finds their apparent magnitude, as opposed to absolute
 
If we assume there's nothing special about planets near earth, we can plot any star on an HR diagram and infer its distance  
This is called spectroscopic parallax
 ![Spectroscopic Parallax Spectroscopic Parallax is a method of determining distances to stars summarized with the following flowchart: Spectrum of star Spectral class of star Apparent magnitude (m) Luminosity class of star HR diagram Absolute magnitude (M) (m-M+5)/5 d=lO where d is distance in parsecs ](Exported%20image%2020240525203941-3.png) ![25,000 10,000 -10 M - -0.8 +10 Temperatur (K) 6,000 gipntS• 3"00 104 Gamma "2 Crucis 102 10- Spectroscopic Parallax for Gamma Crucis ](Exported%20image%2020240525203941-4.png)  

Allows us to measure distance of stars too far to measure regular parallax
