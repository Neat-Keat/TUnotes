EXAM THURSDAY!!!!!!!!  
CHAPTERS 1 THRU 6  
Exam only covers the parts of ch 6 that we cover today
 
Mostly multiple choice  
25 short answer q's, 3% each  
25% elsewhere

Cavity Radiation  
Also called blackbody radiation  
Chart the radiation's wavelength against its intensity

HOTTER OBJECTS PEAK IN SHORTER WAVELENGTHS  
HOTTER OBJECTS ARE BRIGHTER
 
Wien's Displacement law  
The peak wavelength = (constant) / (temperature)  
Where C depends on units being used  
More energy in = more energy out
 
Stefan-Boltzmann Law  
Flux: radiant energy emitted from each unit area for a source
 ![Flux at distance r a r With luminosity L surface area of sphere 4:tF ](Exported%20image%2020240525203906-1.png)  

Flux = (constant) (Temperature)^4  
Only works with Kelvins bc 100F and –100F return the same answer
 
Flux is for a unit area  
Luminosity is the whole source  
Luminosity = flux * area
 
FOR A SPHERE:  
(4piR^2)((constant)T^4)
   

The sun glows white, atmosphere scatters light and makes it look more yellow
 
Looking at the blackbody curves above, classical theory is limited  
Then Plank came around
 
Classical Oscillator (mass on spring)  
Amplitude (energy) and Frequency are totally independent  
Planck said they're not!
 
Planck's Proposal  
E(oscillator) = hf  
Where h = Planck's constant
 
Leads to the idea that radiation fields are quantized, leading to the idea of photons  
Also leads to Einstein's photoelectric theory in 1905
 
Explained by Bohr's atom about 8 years later
 
INVERSE SQUARE LAW

LENSES
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203906-2.png)   
Distance from center of lens to focal point = focal length (or F-Stop!)
 
Lenses gather more light from a source than you'd normally be able to see  
Long focal length means less bending  
Short focal length means more bending
 
TELESCOPES (Light Buckets)
 
Refractors

Reflectors

Light Gathering Power of a Telescope depends on the AREA of the OBJECTIVE LENS/MIRROR
 
App theres a 16 in telescope on the roof lmfao
 
Pi10^2 – pi1^2  
100pi-1pi  
Drilling a 1in diameter hole in a 10 in diameter mirror only loses 1% light gathering power
   

Chromatic Abberation

![chromatic abe-raaon ](Exported%20image%2020240525203906-5.png)

This smears images  
Larger lenses smear more
 
Can be fixed by coating the lens to compensate for this  
Very difficult with larger lenses
 
Also difficult for larger lenses to be of a pure composition  
Also larger lenses are much much much much much heavier  
They can sag and distort images
 
This is why we don’t have many modern, large telescopes
