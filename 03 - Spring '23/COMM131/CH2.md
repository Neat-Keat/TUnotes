Public speaking's goal is the desired response from listeners, but not at any cost  
It has ethical responsibilities  
Hitler lmfao
 
**Ethical Decisions:** Sound ethical decisions involve weighing a potential course of action against a set of ethical standards or guidelines
 
You have an obligation to both yourself and your audience to be prepared
 
Don’t plagiarize speeches lol  
Don’t name call or use slurs lol
 
Be ethical all the time, not when its convenient
 
**Global Plagiarism:** stealing a speech entirely from another source and passing it off as your own.  
**Patchwork Plagiarism:** stealing from 2 or 3 sources  
**Incremental Plagiarism:** failing to give credit for particular parts, esp. quotes and paraphrases
 
Listeners also have ethical duties

1. Listen courteously and attentively
2. Avoid prejudging the speaker
3. Maintain the free and open expression of ideas
