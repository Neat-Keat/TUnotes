Dealing with Nervousness:

1. Acquire speaking experience
2. Prepare, Prepare, Prepare
    
    1. 1 minute of speech = 1 hour of prep
3. Think Positively
    
    1. 5 good thoughts for every bad thought
4. Use the power of visualization
5. Know that nervousness isn't visible
6. Don’t expect perfection

￼ALSO!

- Sleep well the day before
- Have a quiet way to use adrenaline (squeeze hands together/tense + relax legs)
- Work extra hard on intro, that’s where nervousness peaks
- Make eye contact with audience members
- Focus on communicating, not your stage fright
- Use visual aids to draw attention away from you

￼Confidence breeds confidence
 
"critical thinking is focused, organized thinking, the ability to see clearly the relationships among ideas."
 
Organizing a speech shapes the ideas themselves
 
Success depends on you: your personal credibility, subject knowledge, speech preparation, speaking mannerisms, audience sensitivity
 
Be enthusiastic!
 
**Message:** whatever a speaker communicates to someone else.
 
Public speaking aims to make the intended message the communicated message  
Depends on BOTH verbal and nonverbal info
 
**Channel:** the means by which a message is communicated  
**Listener:** the person receiving the communicated message  
**Frame of Reference:** the total of a listener's knowledge, experience, goals, values, and attitudes
 
Bc everyone has a different frame of reference, you need to adapt the message to the audience
 
**Feedback:** messages, usually nonverbal, from listener to speaker  
**Interference:** anything that impedes the communication of a message.  
External (traffic noise, room's hot) + Internal (audience has a toothache)  
**Situation:** Time and place that communication occurs
 
Don’t overlook multicultural values  
Don’t be ethnocentric
 
Public speaking imposes strict time limitations and requires detailed prep work, requires more formal language, and demands a different method of delivery
