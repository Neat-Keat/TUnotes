Triton has evidence of geysers  
Triton rotates on a tilted plane around Neptune  
Triton has a retrograde motion around Neptune, the only exception to the rule in the solar system
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525204002-0.png)   
these are all unstable conditions, so how did Triton get there?  
captured asteroid prolly  
this is unusual bc of how big it is
 
The internal Structure of Neptune, from outside to core:
 
1) upper atmosphere, top clouds  
2) Atmosphere consisting of hydrogen, helium, and methane gas  
3) Mantle consisting of water, ammonia, and methane ices  
4) Core consisting of rock (silicates and nickel-iron)
 
Equatorial Bulges on Uranus due to angular momentum of triton  
Causes Triton's orbit to be offcenter
 
equatorial bulges come from a planet's rapid rotation  
tidal bulges care caused by satellites  
bc of Triton's retrograde orbit, the tidal bulge slows motion of Triton, meaning eventually it will lose so much energy it will crash into Uranus  
or it'll hit the roche limit and give uranus more rings!!
   

Rings - discovery
 
Rings of Saturn known abt since 1610  
app they disappeared for a minute??  
app this happens regularly??  
its due to our perspective relative to Saturn

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525204002-1.png)  

we had Uranus pass infront of a star, which we used to analyze it's atmosphere  
but the starlight disappeared 3x on each side of the planet  
omg guys uranus has rings!!  
1977

Voyager 2 in the 70's and 80's directly observed Jupiter and Neptunes Rings

RINGS OF SATURN  
the outer rings have a diameter of 240,000 km  
the distance between the Earth and Moon is 384,000 km  
using Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd law T^2 = (4pi^2/GM)a^3  
implies that each ring is composed of individual particles  
dust, rocks ~ few meters  
the rings are very thin, only about 10m
 ![Encke Division Saturn D Ring F Ring G Ring ](Exported%20image%2020240525204002-5.png)   
The cassini division exists  
analyzing the T^2=a^3 law, the orbit of mimas is twice the distance of the cassini division  
this causes particles that _would_ have been trapped in the cassini division to be absorbed into mimas instead #address
 
Resonance with Mimas creates cassini division (gap) in rings of saturn  
Gap has a period T  
Mimas has a period 2T  
any particles in the gap go around 2x for mimas going around 1x, so each time the particle gets pulled closer and closer each orbit, eventually being pulled out of the division
 
jupiter has gaps for the same reason too!
 
what about the isolated F, G, and E rings of saturn?  
similar logic to resonance, but shepard satellites are on the inside, not the outside
 
Energy and Orbits
 
Kinetic energy  
energy of motion  
always positive  
Potential Energy  
energy of position  
Bound particles have NEGATIVE PE
 
As a satellite, the further from a body you are, the less KE you have, and the more PE you have
 
consider a particle with a bound orbit and:  
KE = +10  
PE = -20  
TE = -10
 
consider another bound particle, further out:  
KE = +5  
PE = -10  
TE = -5
 
3rd time, further out  
|KE| = |PE| -> TE = 0, UNBOUND BAYBEE!!
 
how does this apply to the rings of saturn?
 
Shepherd satellites of Saturn  
any particles in between Prometheus (faster) and Pandora (slower) are bound  
the satellites give/take speed to keep them between the two
 
Uranus has shepherd satellites too!!
