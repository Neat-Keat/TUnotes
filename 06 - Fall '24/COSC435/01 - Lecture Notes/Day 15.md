tiny bit on the format of the final
next week, 7:30-9:30 pm

100 points over 2 parts:
- Multiple choice (25-30 Q's)
- Series of Tasks

tasks are completed in Android Studio in LabsApp
- on a branch called "final_exam"
- make sure it builds before next week!!

on the day, at 7:30, we're given MainActivity
- we need to open up the file, copy and paste it over the existing MainActivity
- When we're done, we copy/paste everything in MainActivity and submit that on BB!

supporting code at the bottom will be filled in
don't type in anything outside of MainActivity

Multiple Choice lasts 30 minutes
tasks is the remaining amount of time
