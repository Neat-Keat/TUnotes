Today:
	Lipids! (on the exam!!)

----------------

Lipids (dont fit monomer/polymer relationship)
- loosely defined group of molecules with one main chemical characteristic
	- THEY ARE INSOLUBLE IN WATER
- high proportion of nonpolar C-H bonds causes the molecule to be *hydrophobic*
- includes fats, oils, waxes, steroids, and even some vitamins
- not defined by structure or composition
- only class of biologic molecule that is NOT a polymer

#MEMORIZE nonpolar -> hydrophobic

Types of lipids found in cells
* Triglycerides (Fat, Oil, Wax)
	* *Three* fatty acids linked to glycerol
* Steroids
	* *Four*-ring structure
* Terpenes
	* Biological pigments (chlorophyll, retinal)
* Phospholipids
	* glycerol + phosphate group and *Two* fatty acids

Predominately nonpolar, but the OH end can interact with water

Triglycerides
- composed of 1 glycerol and 3 fatty acids
- Fatty acids
	- Need not be identical
	- chain length varies (14, 16, 18, 20 carbons most common)
	- Saturated - no double bonds between carbon atoms = as many hydrogen atoms as possible
		- higher melting point, animal origin, solid at room temp
	- Unsaturated - 1 or more double bonds between C
		- low melting point, plant origin, liquid at room temp
		- Monounsaturated, polyunsaturated
	- Trans fats produced industrially

	glycerol is polar
	- fatty acids attach to each OH group via dehydration synthesis
		- then its a tryglyceride!

predominately non-polar, water soluble
if you see the structure, know tryglyceride/ fat/ lipid

note that saturated fats have the max number of H, whereas the double bonds (?) in unsaturated fats dont allow for it

a C=C cant rotate the same as a C-C bond
	this leads to the kinky structure of unsaturated fats, they aren't flexible enough to compact

think butter and olive oil

trans fats
	take liquid, unsaturated fats, then hydrogenate them to become solid
	increase risk for heart disease
	worse for you than saturated fats

A -glycerol (polar, becomes nonpolar after bonding)
B- Fatty acids
C- saturated fatty acid tails
D- unsaturated fatty acid

![[Pasted image 20240918092220.png]]
A - Saturated Fatty acid
B - CIS Unsaturated Fatty acid
C - Trans unsaturated Fatty acid

RECOGNIZE THE STRUCTURE TOP RIGHT!!

cholesterol is completely essential for the cell membrane
	too much is bad for your blood vessels
	the base on which steroids are made

Cholesterol
- common component in animal cell membranes
- most important steroid molecule in your body because it is the precursor for making other steroids (aka steroid hormones)
	- steroid hormones act as a regulatory chemical, entering a target cell and activating the transcription of specific genes

The phosphate groups carry negative charge  -> extremely hydrophilic
the dichotomy of polarity is referred to the quality of *Amphipathic*

![[Pasted image 20240918092946.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240918092959.png]]
when placed in water, they self assemble into a phospholipid bilayer
	if its only one layer:
	![[Pasted image 20240918093113.png]]
	otherwise its a bilayer
	![[Pasted image 20240918093145.png]]

the hydrophobic tails' interiors are shielded from water by the hydrophilic heads

![[Pasted image 20240918093327.png]]
#MEMORIZE definition of Amphipathic

if phospholipids were dropped in olive oil, then the reverse structure would happen, with the tails facing out and the heads facing in

![[Pasted image 20240918093446.png]]
is still fluid, the phospholipids are always moving
	phospholipids cannot easily flip flop to the other side because its not energetically favorable for the hydrophilic heads to go through the dry interior

----------------------------
in class review!

from today, know:
	structure of tryglyceride
	structure of steroids
	phospholipids
		structure
		function

bond (C6H12O6)10
	C60H120O60 - (H2O)9
	= C60H102O51
This concept is ON the exam

30 mc questions + some Short answers
should take 40-45 minutes
	phone off and silent
	not wearing smart watches
	nothing with you at your seat except pencil, pen, eraser, drink
	no ones allowed to leave the room unless you're done
	cant wear baseball cap
