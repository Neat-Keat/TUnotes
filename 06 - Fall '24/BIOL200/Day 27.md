today: chapter 14! (slides not posted yet)
	structure and replication of DNA (the molecule of heredity)

# Cell Division!
3 Major challenges
1. The cell must copy the DNA = DNA replication
2. the cell must separate the DNA copies = karyokinesis (division of the nucleus) of packaged DNA (chromosomes)
3. the physical cell must divide = cytokinesis

last friday we looked at a vid of a cell  in mitosis dividing
	had to wait for the last chromosome to align before going into anaphase

Recall Nucleotide structure

Recall the phosphodiester bond (5' to 3' orientation)

Q. What is complimentary to 5' ATTGCTGAGAG 3'
A. 5'  CTCTCAGCAAT 3' (flipped bc theyre antiparallel)

sequence of one strand specifies the sequence of the other

# CH 14 outline:
- DNA is the genetic material: a history
- DNA replication
- telomeres
- DNA repair

people originally thought that proteins were the molecule of heredity
look into the Hershey & Chase -1952 experiment

# Chargaff's Rules
- Erwin Chargaff (1952) determined chemically that:
	- Amount of *adenine* = amount of *thymine*
	- Amont of *cytosine* = amount of *guanine*
	- always an equal proportion of purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T)

#MEMORIZE
Q. sample is 15% Thymine, percents of other 3?
A. A= 15%, C = 35%, G = 35%

# Rosalind Franklin
- performed X-ray diffraction studies to identify the 3D structure
	- discovered that DNA is helical
	- using Maurice Wilkins' DNA fibers, discovered that the molecule has a diameter of 2nm and makes a complete turn of the helix every 3.4nm
- was scammed out of a nobel prize by wattson and crick who stole the model bc sexism
	- she died of ovarian cancer at 37 bc of all her XRay experiments

# DNA Replication
- requires 3 things
	- something to copy
		= parental DNA molecule (template)
	- something to do the copying
		= enzymes
	- Building blocks to make copy
		= Nucleotide triphosphates (like ATP!!)
