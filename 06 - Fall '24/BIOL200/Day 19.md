today:
finish ch6, start ch 7

next exam is monday
50 minutes
covers all of chapters 4,5,6
	components of plasma membrana
	active/passive transport
	osmosis
	plant vs animal cell
	prokaryotes vs eukaryotes
	energy
		forms of energy
		thermodynamics laws
	among other stuff that i missed lmfaoo

ATPs energy comes from the breaking of the phosphate groups
	think of like a molecular coiled spring
	the negative charges repel each other
	bond between 3rd and 2nd as well as 2nd and 1st releases energy
		but NOT 1st and the ribose, because there's no charge!

# ATP cycle
- ATP hydrolysis drives *endergonic* reactions
	- unstable bonds have low activation energy and are easily broken
	- when broken, can transfer a considerable amount of energy
	- 7.3kcal/mol is released
	- coupled reaction results in net release of energy
		- ($\Delta$G = eexergonic and spontaneous)

- ATP not suitable for long-term energy storage
	- high energy bonds in ATP are unstable
	- Fats and carbohydrates better
	- Cells store only a few seconds worth of ATP; continually are making more ADP + P_i
- Estimated that even a sedentary individual turns over an amount of ATP in one day roughly equal to his or her body weight!

chemical work,
transport,
movement all require ATP

# Metabolism
- total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism
- *Anabolic* reactions/anabolism
	- expend energy to build up molecules
	- think of anabolic steroids to speed up muscle growth
- *Catabolic* reactions/catabolism
	- harvest energy by breaking down molecules

# Biochemical Pathways
- reactions occur in a sequence
- product of one reaction is the substrate for the next
- pathways are often compartmentalized inside organelles

# Summary
- Two types of energy
- Two laws of thermodynamics
- Free energy, entropy, enthalpy
- Endergonic vs Exergonic reactions
- Activation energy, catalysts
- Enzymes:
	- substrate, binding site, induced fit
	- Environmental factors influence function
	- Inhibition, activation, allosteric enzyme
- Metabolism
	- Catabolism
	- Anabolism
- Biochemical Pathways

Now, walk thru an exergonic example graph, making sure we know how to read and figure out activation energy and $\Delta$G
![[Pasted image 20241011093800.png]]
be able to recreate this graph basically
also KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENDERGONIC AND EXERGONIC!!!! #MEMORIZE 

now we review

study guide!
- be able to label most of a cell on a diagram
	- both plant, animal, and prokaryote
- 4 things all cells have in common
	- cytoplasm
	- genetic material
	- ribosomes
	- plasma membrane
- cell wall is made of cellulose
	- plasmodesmata in the cell wall connects adjacent cells
- Nucleus contains:
	- surrounded by nuclear envelope
		- made of 2 membranes
		- outer layer is contiguous with the RER (physically attached to)
	- big circular things are nuclear pores
		- allows certain stuff to enter and exit
			- like ribosomes, and *mRNA*
	- dark staining region is the nucleolus
- prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome
- eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes
- plant cells have:
	- cell wall
	- central vacuole
	- chloroplast (and mitochondria!)
- Endomembrane system!
	- be able to name all the parts
- lysosomes break down stuff
- cytoskeleton stuff
	- microtubules
	- intermediate filaments
	- microfilament
	- centrioles (made of other stuff)
	- know how they're different and what they do
- Structures of choroplast and mitochondria
	- mitochondria
		- 2 membranes, their own DNA, etc
- for membranes:
	- phospholipid bilayer (label each part)
	- why only certain stuff can get in
	- permeability scale
		- small, nonpolar -> small polar -> large -> ions (not at all)
		- establishes ion gradients (useful for energy transfer)
- whats oxidation vs reduction
	- gain vs loss of an electron
- enzyme structure
- types of energy
