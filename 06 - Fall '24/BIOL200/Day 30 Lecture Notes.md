Origin of Replication: Where DNA replication starts

replication starts bidirectionally
	primase lays down an RNA primer (~20 nucleotides)
	DNA polymerase else adds nucleotides to the 3' end
		the red parts indicate the 5', the arrows indicate the 3' end
		can lay down 1000 new nucleotides a second
	how to get rid of the RNA primers?

# Leading-strand synthesis
Single priming event
Strand extended by DNA Pol III
- processivity - the ability of a polymerase to stay attached
- $\beta$ subunit forms "Sliding clamp" to keep DNA Pol III attached to DNA (high processivity)

# Lagging-strand synthesis requires additional enzymes
Discontinuous synthesis
- DNA Pol III (like leading strand)
- Primase - makes RNA primer for each Okazaki fragment
- DNA Pol I - Removes all RNA primers and replaces with DNA
- DNA ligase - seals backbone

Termination occurs at specific site
- DNA gyrase unlinks 22 copies

DNA Pol I can remove RNA primers in the chain AND fill it in with new nucleotides
> new nucleotides are only ever added to the 3' OH group

NOTE!!
	the last added nucleotide's 3'OH is NOT connected to the 5' P in Okazaki fragments (called a nick)
	- needs DNA ligase to seal these nicks

#MEMORIZE an animation of replication

# Replisome
- Enzymes involved in DNA replication form a *macromolecular* assembly
- 2 main components
	- Primosome
		- Primase, helicase, accessory proteins
	- Complex of 2 DNA pol III polymerases
		- one for each strand

#MEMORIZE this, be able to label it on exams!
> is really really important you learn these terms and what they do


recall DNA gyrase undoes supercoils!
	
we describe DNA replication as:
	**Semi-discontinuous** and
	**Semi-conservative**
semi-continuous -> leading is, lagging isnt
semi-conservative -> daughter DNA has one parent strand, one child strand

# Eukaryotic Replication
Complicated by:
- larger amount of DNA in multiple chromosomes
- Complex packaging
- Linear structure
![[Pasted image 20241111093326.png]]

# Eukaryotic replication uses multiple origins
Basic enzymology is similar
- requires new enzymatic activity for dealing with ends only
Multiple replicons - multiple origins of replications for each chromosome
- not sequence specific; can be adjusted
	- ex: early in development when cells divide rapidly, more origins can be used

# The eukaryotic replication fork is more complex
Before S phase, helicases are loaded onto possible replication origins, but not activated
During S phase, a subset of these are activated, and the rest of the replisome assembled
- priming uses a complex of both DNA polymerase $\alpha$ and primase
- DNA polymerase epsilon (Pol $\epsilon$ ) synthesizes leading strand
- DNA polymerase delta (Pol $\delta$ synthesizes lagging strand)

every round of replication, the chromosome gets a bit shorter!!
- eukaryotic cells solve this by putting telomeres on the ends!

# Linear chromosomes have specialized ends
Telomeres
- specialized structures found on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes
- composed of specific sequences
protect ends of chromosomes from nucleases
maintain the integrity of linear chromosomes

# Telomeres
- gradual shortening of chromosomes with each round of cell division
	- unable to replicate last section of lagging strand
- **Telomeres** are specialized structures found on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes
- protect ends of chromosomes from nucleases and maintain the integrity of linear chromosomes
![[Pasted image 20241111094035.png]]

only really active in embryogenesis
aging shortens telomeres
	a lot of cancers turn on telomeres

# DNA Repair
- errors due to replication
	- DNA polymerases have proofreading ability
- Mutagens - any agent that increases the number of mutations above background level
	- radiation and chemicals
- Importance of DNA repair systems that have been discovered

accuracy = 1 in every 100,000 is wrong
	since E coli is 40,000,000 long, each has ~ 40 mismatched bases
	thats way too many!!

cells evolved ways to repair mutated DNA

Falls into 2 general categories
1. Specific repair
	1. targets a single kind of lesion in DNA and repairs only that damage
2. Nonspecific
	- Use a single mechanism to repair multiple kinds of lesions in DNA	
# Photorepair
- specific repair mechanism
- repairs one particular form of damage caused by UV light
- thymine dimers
	- covalent link of adjacent thymine bases in DNA
- Photolyase
	- absorbs light in visible range
	- uses this energy to cleave thymine dimer

we dont have it tho lololol

# Excision repair
- nonspecific repair
- damaged region is removed and replaced by DNA synthesis
- 3 steps
	1. recognition of damage
	2. removal of the damaged region
	3. resynthesis using the information on the undamaged strand as a template
