### start of ch7

we'll do a light version of ch8 later
no class next friday!

ch7 smartbooks open
ch8 is photosynthesis, we are NOT doing the whole chapter
then we'll move on to how cells divide, and how DNA gets copied
	then genetics! (how genes work (central dogma))

average on the multiple choice was a 66% (out of all 120 people)

# Chapter 7: How Cells Harvest Energy

catabolic -> exergonic (release energy)

## Outline
- Redox reactions - review
- ATP - review
- Electron acceptors - NAD+/NADH
- Cellular Respiration
	- Glycolysis
	- Pyruvate oxidation
	- Citric acid cycle
	- Electron transport/chemiosmosis/ATP synthesis
- Fermentation - in absence of oxygen

we eat food so we can make ATP
Cellular Respiration = Complete oxidation (breakdown) of glucose  (the main example)

plants generate oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis

Cellular Respiration:

## Respiration
Organisms can be classified based on how they obtain energy:
*Autotrophs:*
- able to produce their own organic molecules through photosynthesis
*Heterotrophs*
- live on organic compounds produced by other organisms
all organisms use cellular respiration to extract energy from organic molecules

## Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration is a series of reactions
Oxidized - loss of electrons
Reduced - gain of electron
Dehydrogenation - lost electrons are accompanied by protons
	a hydrogen atom is lost (1 electron, 1 proton)

> Covalent Bonds = Potential Energy

## Reduction-Oxidation: Redox Reactions
- Coupled chemical reactions that involve e- transfer
- Drive ATP formation
- When an atom or molecule **Gains** an electron, it is **reduced** -> electron acceptor
- When an atom or molecule **Loses** an electron, it is **Oxidized** -> electron donor
- ...
- ...

> OILRIG
> Oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
> and bc electrons represent energy, it represents energy changes too!

NAD = nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide

NADH has the higher energy #MEMORIZE 

think of this system as like a hot potato passing the 2 electrons around

## Redox reactions
- during redox reactions, electrons carry energy from one molecule to another
- NAD+
- ...
- ...

- in overall cellular energy harvest:
	 - dozens of redox reactions take place
	 - number of eletron accep...
	- ...
- ...

NAD+ = oxidized
NADH = reduced

## ATP
Cells use ATP to frive endergonic reactions
	$\Delta$G (free energy) of hydrolyzing terminal phosphate = -7.3 kcal/mal.
2 mechanisms for synthesis
1. *Substrate-level *
	- transfer phosphate group directly to ADP
	- during glycolysis
2. *Oxidative phosphorylation*
	- ATP synthase uses energy from a proton gradient

## Electron Acceptors
Aerobic respiration
- final electron receptor is oxygen (O_2)
Anaerobic respiration
- final electron acceptor is an inorganic molecule (not O2)
Fermentation
- final electron acceptor is an organic molecule

> role of oxygen = final electron receptor #MEMORIZE
> Oxygen works really well at this bc its electronegativity makes it hold electrons tightly

## Oxidation of glucose
4 stages:
1. Glycolysis
2. Pyruvate oxidation
3. Citric acid cycle
4. electron transport chain & chemiosmosis

>know what goes in, what comes out, where it happens, and whether or not it uses oxygen

### Glycolysis
means sugar breaking
split to 2 3 carbon molecules called Pyruvate
an ancient pathway that all cells can do
happens in the cytoplasm

- Converts 1 glucose (6 carbons) to 2 pyruvate (3 carbons each)
- 10-step biochemical pathway (dont need to memorize)
- Occurs in the cytoplasm
- *Net* production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation (takes 2 to start, so it releases 4 lol)
- 2 NADH produced by the reduction of NAD+

TLDR cells *can* break apart glucose for energy (not much, but some)

#### NADH must be recycled
- for glycolysis to continue, NADH must be recycled to NAH+ by:
	- Aerobic respiration
		- Oxygen is available as the final electron acceptor
		- produces significant amount of ATP
	- Fermentation
		- Occurs when oxygen is not available
		- organic molecule is the final electron acceptor 
		- lactic acid buildup!

we love yeast because they make ethanol and CO2 when they ferment
	useful in bread and soda lol
