> in a recessive inheritance, the affected people are homozygous recessive #MEMORIZE

TT x TT = no affected children
TT x Tt = 25% affected children

# Sex linkage
in orgainisms with XY sex-determination (like humans) few genes from Y chromosome are expressed
Result is that recessive alleles on X chromosome have no active partner on Y, therefore, a single recessive sex-linked gene can produce recessive phenotype
Certain genetic diseases affect males to a greater degree than females as a result
X-linked recessive alleles:
- Red-green color blindness
- Hemophilia

# Hemophilia
Disease that affects a single proteins in a cascade of proteins involved in the formation of blood clots
form of hemophilia is caused by an X-linked recessive allele
- heterozygous females are asymptomatic carriers
allele for hemophilia was introduced into a number of different European royal families by Queen Victoria of England

$X^HX^H$ - unaffected female
$X^HY$ - unaffected male
$X^HX^h$ - carrier female
$X^hY$ - affected male
$X^hX^h$ - affected female (possible but rare)

3 types of pedigrees:
- dominant trait
- recessive trait
- sex related trait

# Dosage compensation
Ensures equal expression of genes from sex chromosomes even though number of chromosomes is different between sexes
In mammalian female cells, 1 X chromosome is randomly inactivated and is highly condensed into a *Barr body*
Females heterozygous for genes on the X chromosome are genetic mosaics
- Ex: Tortoiseshell and Calico cats

# Chromosome theory exceptions
- mitochondria and chloroplasts contain genes
- traits controlled by these genes ==do not== follow the chromosomal theory of inheritance
- genes from mitochondria and chloroplasts are often passed to the offspring by only one parent, often the mother, called *maternal inheritance*
- in plants, chloroplasts are also often inherited from the mother, although this is species dependent
# Nondisjunction changes chromosome number
*Nondisjunction* is the failure of homologues or sister chromatids to separate properly during meiosis
*Aneuploids* - gain or loss of a chromosome, the result of nondisjunction
- Monosomy - loss
- Trisomy - gain
- In all but a few cases, do not survive

# Nondisjunction of sex chromosomes
- do not generally experience severe developmental abnormalities
- individuals have somewhat abnormal features, but often reach maturity and in some cases may be fertile
- XXX - triple-X females
- XXY - males (Klinefelter syndrome)
- XO - females (Turner syndrome)
- OY - nonviable zygotes
- XYY - males (Jacob syndrome)

# CH 15 - Genes and How They Work

slides not posted yet

# Outline
- genes are blueprints
	- central dogma
	- the genetic code
- Prokaryotic Transcription
- Eukaryotic Transcription
	- how is it different from prokaryotes?
- Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Translation
- Mutation

# Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
- first described by Francis Crick
- Information only flows from:
	- ==DNA -> RNA -> protein==
- **Transcription** = DNA -> RNA
- **Translation** = RNA -> protein
- Exception: Retroviruses

#MEMORIZE the differences between 
- Replication
	- DNA making copies of itself in S Phase
- Transcription
	- making a copy of info in RNA (same "language")
- Translation
	- making a protein from RNA (different "language")

In Eukaryotes, Replication and Transcription in Nucleus, Translation in Cytoplasm
In prokaryotes, all in Cytoplasm

# Information flows from DNA to RNA to Proteins
DNA (Informaiton storage)
mRNA (Information carrier) 
Proteins (active cell machinery)

# Transcription vs. Translation
- Transcription
	- DNA- directed synthesis of RNA
	- Only template strand of DNA used
	- T (thymine) in DNA replaced by U (uracil) in RNA
	- mRNA used to direct synthesis of polypeptides
- Translation
	- ...
	- ...
	- ...

# RNA
- ALl synthesized from DNA template by transcription
	- Messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
	- Transfer RNA (tRNA)
	- Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)
	- Signal recognition particle RNA (SRP RNA)
	- ...

# Genetic Code

# In the Genetic Code, How many Bases Form a "Word"?
There are 4 RNA bases (U, C, A, G) and they must specify 20 amino acids.
How many mRNA bases specify a single amino acid?

There are only 4 bases, a 1-base code could specify only 4 AmAcids
There are only 4 bases, a 2-base code could specify only 16 AmAcids
There are only 4 bases, a 3-base code could specify 64 AmAcids (64 > 20)!

3 codes do NOT encode an amino acid, they encode either a start signal (1) or a stop signal (3)!

redundancy ensures amino acids are likely made, even with errors
this quality is called *Degeneracy*
