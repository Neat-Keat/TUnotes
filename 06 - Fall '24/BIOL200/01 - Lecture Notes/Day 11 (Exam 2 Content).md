----------

phospholipids
- diverse
	- glycerol & 2 fatty acids
	- phosphate group
	- another polar group
	- form all biological membranes

lipids in general are nonpolar -> hydrophobic
phospholipids' heads are negatively charged (phosphate group) -> hydrophillic
	both hydrophobic and hydrophillic at the same time -> ampipathic (so are steroids!)

phospholipid bilayer - more complicated structure where 2 layers form
	hydrophilic heads point outward
	hydrophobic tails point inward toward each other
lipid bilayers form the basis of biological membranes

membrane lipids
- head = highly  ...
- tail = ...

saturated fatty acids have C-C bonds
	flexible -> more compact
unsaturated fatty acids have C=C bonds
	inflexible -> less compact

Phospholipid Bilayer
	2 sheets of phospholipid molecules align
spontaneous formation
	no outside input of energy required

Cellular membrane components
1. *Phospholipid bilayer*
	1. flexible matrix, barrier to permeability
2. *Transmembrane proteins*
	1. integral membrane proteins
	2. go all the way through the membrane
	3. called integral
	4. as opposed to peripheral proteins, on the outside of the bilayer
3. *Interior protein network*
	1. peripheral or Intracellular membrane proteins
4. *Cell surface markers*
	1. glycoproteins and glycolipids
		1. proteins and lipids with sugars attached to them
5. *Cholesterol or phytosterols*
	1. helps maintain the right amount of fluidity
	2. wedges between the fatty acid groups, has 1 little OH, allows it to orient in the membrane

Be able to draw a segment of the phospholipid bilayer for exam
proteins in the membrane are attached to and function with other proteins INside AND OUTside the cell

hexagon chain -> sugars/carbs

Movement of Molecules Diffusion
	Molecules (solutes) move from regions of high concentration (across a membrane) to regions of lower concentration

think of the demo where blue dye disperses faster in hot water vs cold water

molecules are randomly moving all of the time

concentration gradient: 
	high = a lot of something in an area
	low = a little of something in an area

get resources in, get waste out (like CO2!)

glucose is polar, how does it get through the membrane?

transport across membranes
	permeability: tendency to allow a given substance to pass across
phospholipid bilayers - *SELECTIVE PERMEABILITY*
- 2 major factors: Molcule Size & Attraction to Water

A: the membrane becomes less permeable -> less fluid

![[Pasted image 20240923093712.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240923093825.png]]
the most permeable
	small, non-polar molecules (O2, CO2, N2) (10^-1)
	small, uncharged polar molecules (H2), urea, glycerol) (10^-4)
	--------------------------------------------------------
	large, unchained polar molecules (Glucose, sucrose) (10^-8)
	Ions (Cl-, K+, Na+) (10^-10)
the least permeable

#MEMORIZE in osmosis, water moves across a selective membrane towards the area of higher solute concentration

What would happen to a membrane vesicle containing pure water if it is placed into a solution containing 1M valine (phospholipid membranes are impermeable to valine)? Would osmosis occur and if so, in which direction?
	Yes, towards the side with the valine
