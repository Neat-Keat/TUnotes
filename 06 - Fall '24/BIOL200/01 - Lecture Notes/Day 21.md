Aerobic respiration has 4 steps:
1. Glycolysis
2. Pyruvate Oxidation
3. Citric Acid Cycle
4. Electron Transport Chain
	1. protons are charged, cant pass the phospholipid membrane
		1. can only pass back thru with the ATP Synthase Enzyme

in the matrix of the mitochondria:
	the end of the ETC: electrons that have lost their energy HAVE to go to a final electron acceptor (ie Oxygen in Aerobic respiration)

# Energy yield of respiration
Theoretical energy yield
	32 ATP per glucose in bacteria #MEMORIZE 
	30 in Eukaryotes #MEMORIZE
P/O ratio (phosphate-to-oxygen ratio) is the amount of ATP synthesized per 02 molecule
Theoretical and direct calculation of P/O has been contentious and has changed over time
![[Pasted image 20241022222010.png]]

# regulation of respiration
Example of feedback inhibition
2 key control points:
1. In glycolysis
	1. phosphofructokinase is allosterically inhibited by ATP and/or citrate
2. In pyruvate oxidation/citric acid cycle
	1. Pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibited by high levels of NADH
	2. Citrate synthetase inhibited by high levels of ATP

# Oxidation without O2
1. Anaerobic respiration
	1. use of *inorganic* molecules (other than O2) as final electron acceptor at end of ETC
	2. Many prokaryotes use sulfur, nitrate, carbon dioxide or even inorganic metals
2. Fermentation
	1. use of *organic* molecules as final electron acceptor
	2. ATP generation from glycolysis only

# Anaerobic respiration
Dont need to memorize just know it mostly happens in prokaryotes

Methanogens
- CO2 is reduced to CH4 (methane)
- found in diverse organisms including cows
Sulfur prokaryotes
- inorganic sulfate (SO4) is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
- Early sulfate reducers set the stage for evolution of photosynthesis

# 2 types of fermentation
Based on NADH e- acceptor: pyruvate or acetaldehyde 
![[Pasted image 20241022224315.png]]
^^^ this is what happens when you work out and your muscles run out of O2
OR:
![[Pasted image 20241022224454.png]]
^^^like yeast!
# Fermentation
Reduces organic molecules in order to regenerate NAD+
1. Ethanol fermentation occurs in yeast
	1. CO2, ethanol, and NAD+ are produced
2. Lactic acid fermentation
	1. occurs in animal cells (especially muscles)
	2. electrons are transferred from NADH to pyruvate to produce lactic acid
![[Pasted image 20241022224709.png]]

# Why ferment when you could respire?
- ATP yields:
	- respiration: 30 ATP/1 glucose
	- fermentation: 2 ATP/1 glucose
- Where do most ATP come from?
- what is required?

-> you ***DONT*** ferment if you can respire

# Catabolism of protein
dont need to remember, but heres a quick recap:

amino acids undergo deamination to remove the amino group
remainder of the amino acid is converted to a molecule that enters glycolysis or the citric acid cycle
- Alanine is converted to pyruvate
- aspartate is converted to oxaloacetate

deamination:
![[Pasted image 20241022225007.png]]

# Catabolism of fat
fats are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol
- fatty acids are converted to acetyl groups by $\beta$-oxidation
- oxygen-dependent process
the respiration of a 6-carbon fatty acid yields 20% more energy than a 6-carbon glucose
![[Pasted image 20241022225223.png]]
just need to know that fatty acids get broken down 2 carbons at a time to make Acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle

![[Pasted image 20241022225317.png]]

# Evolution of metabolism
Hypothetical timeline:
1. Ability to store chemical energy in ATP
2. Evolution of glycolysis
	1. pathway found in all living organisms
3. Anoxygenic photosynthesis (using H2S)
4. Use of H2O in photosynthesis (not H2S)
	1. begins permanent change in Earth's atmosphere
5. Evolution of nitrogen fixation
6. Aerobic respiration evolved most recently

just know that glycolysis is ancient, in all organisms, and occurs in the cytoplasm

# Outline
- photosynthesis defined
- electron excitation and energy
- CO2 and the Calvin cycle

# Animation Overview
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giWvr7vFQV8?si=WSdkr67VNwF_T0mj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
- This is a very helpful 3D animation of the entire process of photosynthesis!

# Photosynthesis Overview
- energy for *all* life on earth ultimately comes from photosynthesis
	6CO2 + 12 H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2
- what goes in:
	- CO2, H2O, light (photons)
- what comes out:
	- ATP, Oxygen, sugar (*usually* glucose)
- *Oxygenic photosynthesis is carried out by*
	- cyanobacteria
	- 7 groups of algae
	- all land plants - chloroplasts

![[Pasted image 20241022233816.png]]
# The structure of the Chloroplast
- photosynthesis occurs in the *chloroplast*
- Thylakoids
	- flattened internal membranes of chloroplasts
- Grana
	- stacks of thylakoids
- Stroma
	- space between the thylakoids and the inner membrane
![[Pasted image 20241022233935.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241022234048.png]]
#MEMORIZE the different parts of the chloroplast

# Photosynthesis: 2 reactions
- the *photo* portion (light dependent reactions)
	- light energy converted to chemical energy
	- H2O -> O2
![[Pasted image 20241022234137.png]]
- the *synthesis* portion (light independent)
	- the Calvin cycle
	- CO2 -> carbohydrates

![[Pasted image 20241022234358.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20241022234541.png]]
# The electromagnetic spectrum
- light = electromagnetic radiation
	- particle = photons
	- wave = wavelength

- each photon or wavelength has a specific amount of energy
	- shorter wavelengths = more energy (blue, UV)
	- longer wavelengths = less energy (red, infrared)

- photoelectric effect = removal of an electron from a molecule by light

![[Pasted image 20241022234718.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241022234730.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241022234741.png]]
# absorption spectrum
when a photon strikes a molecule, its energy is either:
- lost as heat
- absorbed by the electrons of the molecule
	- boosts electrons into higher energy level
- absorption spectrum - range and efficiency of photons a molecule is capable of absorbing

![[Pasted image 20241022234848.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241022234942.png]]

# Chlorophyll
- two kinds
- chlorophyll a
	- main photosynthetic pigment
- chlorophyll b
	- broadens the light spectrum used

![[Pasted image 20241022235029.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241022235150.png]]


# Light excites electrons in pigments
- absorbed light excites electrons
- fates for excited electrons:
	- drop back down to a lower energy -> fluorescence
	- drop back down to a lower energy -> heat
	- excite an electron in a nearby pigment and induce resonance
	*- transferred to an electron acceptor in a redox reaction*
here we study the last one 

# Photosystem Organization
- antenna complex
	- hundreds of accessory pigment molecules
	- gather photons and feed the captured light energy to the reaction center
- reaction center
	- 1 or more chlorophyll $\alpha$ molecules
	- passes excited electrons out of the photosystem to electron acceptor

> this is a topic you should be able to write and draw with

------

# Glycolysis
- converts 1 glucose (6 carbons) to 2 pyruvate (3 carbons)
- 10-step biochemical pathway
- occurs in the cytoplasm
- *Net* production of 2 ATP molecules by substrate-level phosphorylation
- 2 NADH produced by the reduction of NAD+
![[Pasted image 20241018092538.png]]

# NADH must be recycled
for glycolysis to continue, NADH must be recycled to NAD+ by either:
1. Aerobic respiration
	1. Oxygen is available as the final electron acceptor.
	2. produces significant amount of ATP
2. Fermentation
	1. Occurs when oxygen is not available
	2. organic molecule is the final electron acceptor.

# Fate of Pyruvate
- depends on oxygen avalibility
	- when oxygen is present, pyrivate is oxidized to acetyl coenzyme! (acetyl-CoA) which enters the citric acid cycle
		- aerobic respiration
	- Without oxygen, pyruvate is reduced in order to oxidize NADH back to NAD+
		- Fermentation.
![[Pasted image 20241018092808.png]]

# Pyruvate Oxidation
- in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is oxidized
	- occurs in mitochondria in eukaryotes
		- multienzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reaction
	- Occurs at the plasma membrane in prokaryotes
![[Pasted image 20241018093200.png]]
	

# Products of pyruvate oxidation
- From each 3-carbon pyruvate molecule:
	- 1 CO2
		- Decarboxylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase
	- 1 NADH
	- 1 acetyl-CoA which consists of 2 carbons from pyruvate attached to coenzyme A
		- Acetyl-CoA proceeds to the citric acid cycle

# Citric Acid Cycle
- Oxidizes the acetyl group from pyruvate
- Occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria
- Biochemical pathway of nine steps in three segments
	1.  Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate -> citrate
	2. Citrate rearrangement and decarboxylation
	3. Regeneration of oxaloacetate

![[Pasted image 20241018093342.png]]

# Citric Acid Cycle Yield
- each Acetyl-CoA entering the citric acid cycle:
	- Releases 2 molecules of CO2
	- Reduces 3 NAD+ to 3 NADH
	- Reduces 1 FAD (electron carrier) to FADH2
	- Produces 1 ATP
	- Regenerates oxaloacetate

# Glucose yield after citric acid cycle
Glucose has been oxidized to:
- 6 CO2
- 4 ATP
- 10 NADH
- 2 FADH2
note NADH and FADH2 proceed to the electron transport chain

Electron transfer has released 53kcal/mol of energy by gradual energy extraction
Energy will be put to use to manufacture ATP

![[Pasted image 20241018093617.png]]
#MEMORIZE structure of mitochondria

# Electron Transport Chain
- ETC is a series of membrane-bound electron carriers
- embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane
- Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred to complexes of the ETC
- Each complex in the chain operates as a *proton pump*, driving protons to the intermembrane space
- electrons move from protein complex to protein complex
![[Pasted image 20241018093748.png]]

# Key Aspects of Electron Transport
- free energy DROPS
- where does it end? has to be a final electron acceptor:
	- ***Oxygen***
- for every 2 e- carriers (4 electrons), one 02 is reduced to 2H2O
- where does the lost free energy go? (not just heat!)

# ATP synthase
ATP synthesis carried out by a tiny rotary motor driven by proton gradient
2 subportions of ATP synthase complex:
	F0 membrane-bound complex
	F1 complex (stalk and knob) has enzymatic activity.
Protons travel through F0 channel, which causes F0 to rotate
Mechanical energy changes confirmation of catalytic domain in F1
![[Pasted image 20241018094525.png]]

# Chemiosmosis
- Accumulation of protons in the *intermembrane space* drives protons into the matrix via diffusion, but this occurs slowly since the membrane is relatively impermeable to ions
- most protons can only reenter matrix thru ATP synthase
	- Uses energy of gradient to make ATP from ATP + Pi
	- Process called chemiosmosis

# Energy Yield of Respiration
theoretical energy yield
	32 ATP/glucose for bacteria
	30 ATP/glucose for eukaryotes
P/O ratio (phosphate-to-oxygen ratio) is the amount of ATP synthesized per O2 molecule
Theoretical and direct calculation of P/O has been contentious and has changed over time
