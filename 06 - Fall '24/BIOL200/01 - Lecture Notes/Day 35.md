# Dictionary
- Quantitative traits
	- Polygenic
- Pleiotropy
- Codominance
- Incomplete Dominance
	- different from codominance by looking at F1's phenotype
- Epistasis -> "stand upon"
	- the action of one gene obscures the effect of another
- Dominant Inheritance
- Hemizygous
	- males only have one copy of a gene bc theyre on the X
# Extensions to Mendel
Mendel's model of inheritance assumes that
- each trait is controlled by a single gene
- each gene has only two alleles
- there is a clear dominant-recessive relationship between the alleles
most genes do not meet these criteria!

# Environmental influence
environment does affect phenotype
*phenotypic plasticity* refers to different phenotypes from same genotype due to environmental conditions
coat color in himalayan rabbits and siamese cats
- allele produces an enzyme that allows pigment production only at temperatures below 30C

# Continuous variation
many traits show *continuous variation* which refers to a range of possible phenotypes across genotypes
often, the phenotype is the result of an accumulation of contributions by multiple genes
these traits show continuous variation and are referred to as *quantitative traits*
- more common than traits due to single genes

# Polygenic inheritance
occurs when multiple genes are involved in controlling the phenotype of a trait
the phenotype is an accumulation of contributions by multiple genes
these traits show continuous variation and are referred to as *quantitative traits*
- ex - human height
- histogram shows normal distribution

# Pleiotropy
*Pleiotropy* refers to an allele which has more than one effect on the phenotype
pleiotropic effects are difficult to predict, because a gene that affects one trait often performs other, unknown functions
this can be seen in human diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia
- multiple symptoms can be traced back to one defective allele

# Multiple alleles
May be more than two alleles for a gene in a population
ABO blood types in humans
- three alleles determine bloodtype
each individual can only have two alleles
Number of alleles possible for any gene is constrained, but usually more than two alleles exist for any gene in an outbreeding population

# Dominance is not always complete
*incomplete dominance*, heterozygote is intermediate in phenotype between the two homozygotes
- Red flowers x white flowers = pink flowers
*Codominance*, heterozygote shows some aspect of the phenotypes of both homozygotes
- type AB blood

- Japanese four o'clocks show *incomplete dominance* of flower color alleles.

# Human ABO blood group
The system demonstrates both
- multiple alleles
	- three alleles of the I gene ($I^A, I^B$, and $i$)
- Codominance
	- $I^A, I^B$ are dominant to $i$ but codominant to each other

> max # of alleles you can have for a gene is 2! one from each parent
> 	but in a population there can be many more


# ABO blood groups illustrate both codominance and multiple alleles

#MEMORIZE
# Epistasis
*Epistasis* is when the action of one gene obscures the effects of another gene
Genes encoding enzymes that act in a single biochemical pathway are NOT independent
Coat color of Labrador retrievers is one example
- primarily controlled by two genes, *Brown* and *Extension*
- Would normally expect four phenotypes to result from two genes (remember pea seed phenotypes) but interaction of gene products from *Brown* and *Extension* results in only three coat colors observed: black, brown (chocolate), or yellow

# How epistasis affects Labrador retriever coat color
Eumelanin vs pheomelanin
two genes control coat color -
B = Brown E = Extension
BB and Bb = black coat color from higher amounts of eumelanin
bb = brown coat color
Extension controls distribution of pigment in tissues
EE and Ee = in skin and coat
ee = only in skin not coat
RESULT = pheomelanin in coat of yellow labs

# Chapter 13
## The Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance, and Human Genetics


# Some human traits exhibit dominant/recessive inheritance
some human traits are controlled by a single gene
- some of these exhibit dominant and recessive inheritance
pedigree analysis is used to track inheritance patterns in families
dominant pedigree example - juvenile glaucoma
recessive pedigree example - albinism

# Dominant pedigree for hereditary juvenile glaucome
- disease causes degeneration of optic nerve leading to blindness
- dominant trait appears in every generation
> only need to inherit one copy!

# Recessive pedigree for albinism
- condition in which the pigment melanin is not produced
- form of albinism due to a nonfunctional allele of the enzyme tyrosinase
- males and females affected equally
- most affected individuals have unaffected parents
> unaffected parents have affected children

# Sex chromosomes
Sex chromosomes are a pair of dissimilar chromosomes that still pair during meiosis and mitosis
Sex determination in *Drosophila* is based on the number of X chromosomes
- 2 X chromosomes = female
- 1 X and 1 Y chromosome = male

# Sex determination
Sex determination varies across organisms:
Is based on presence of a Y chromosome in humans
- 2 X chromosomes = female
- having a Y chromosome (XY) = male
In birds, the male has two Z chromosomes and females are ZW
Some insects are either XX (female) or XO (O indicating absence of a chromosome) in males
