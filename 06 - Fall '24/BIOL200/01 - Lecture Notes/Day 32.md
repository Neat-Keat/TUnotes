# Day  ([[11-15-2024]]) 

Schedule wise:
- SI session 11:30 today
- Finish Meiosis today -> move on to genetics

----------

# The process of Meiosis
- Meiotic cells have an interphase period that is similar to mitosis with G1, S, and G2 phases
- ==After interphase (G1, S, G2)==, germ-line cells enter meiosis I
	- Meiosis I
		- Prophase I
		- Metaphase I
		- Anaphase I
		- Telophase I
	- Meiosis II
		- Prophase II
		- Metaphase II
		- Anaphase II
		- Telophase II

> mitosis produces 2 identical daughter cells
> meiosis produces 4 haploid cells

recall the 3 types of cells:
- Somatic (2n)
- Germ (2n)
- Gametes (1n)

and recall ==ploidy==
- diploid (2n)
- haploid (1n)

Germ cells undergo Meiosis to create haploid gametes
	(a reductional division - cuts the genome in half)

in humans, our 2n number is 46
- 1n number is 23

meiosis has some similarities to mitosis, but here's its key differences
- 2 rounds of division, 4 phases each
	- in Meiosis I, all the weird stuff happens
	- in Meiosis II, it looks like mitosis

>at end of Meiosis I -> 2 daughter cells
> - 1n = haploid!
> - each chromosome = 2 sister chromosomes
## Prophase I
- Chromosomes coil tighter and become visible, nuclear envelope disappears, spindle forms
- Each chromosome is composed of 2 sister chromatids
- Synapsis
	- sites of crossing over form

### Crossing Over
- Genetic recombination between nonsister chromatids
- allows the homologues to exchange chromosomal material
- alleles of genes that were formerly on separate homologues can now be found on the same homologue
- Chiasmata - site of crossing over
	- contact maintained until anaphase I
	
> The homologues separate and move to poles!

- ![[Pasted image 20241115091447.png]]

## Metaphase I
- paired homologues locked together following crossing over
- Microtubules from opposite poles attach to each homologue
	- *Do NOT* attach to each sister chromatid as in mitosis
- Homologues are aligned at the metaphase plate side-by-side
- Orientation of each pair of homologues on the spindle is random
- ![[Pasted image 20241115091702.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241115091807.png]]

## Anaphase I
- Microtubules of the spindle shorten
	- Chiasmata break
- Homologues are separated from each other and move to opposite poles
	- sister chromatids remain attached at centromeres
- Each pole has a complete haploid set of chromosomes
- Independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes
	![[Pasted image 20241115092043.png]]

## Telophase I
- Nuclear envelope re-forms around each daughter nucleus
	- homologous chromosomes are separated
- Sister chromatids are no longer identical due to crossing over
- Cytokinesis may or may not occur after telophase I
- Meiosis II occurs after an interval of variable length

# Final result
- four cells containing NON-IDENTICAL haploid sets of chromosomes
- in animals, develop directly into gametes
- in plants, fungi, and many protists, divide mitotically
	- produce greater number of gametes
--------------

ex
A cell has 16 chromosomes (2n = 16) (AABB genotype) (2.4 MBases)
- Mitosis: 
	- 2 daughters (each 2.4 MBases)
		- AABB
		- AABB
	- 16 chromosomes
- Meiosis
	- 4 daughters (each 1.2 MBases)
		- AB
		- AB
		- AB
		- AB
	- 8 chromosomes

# Errors in Meiosis
- Nondisjunction - failure of chromosomes to move to opposite poles during either meiotic division
- Aneuploid (not true ploidy) gametes - gametes with missing or extra chromosomes
- Most common cause of spontaneous abortion in humans

# Meiosis vs Mitosis
Meiosis is characterized by 4 distinct features:
1. Homologous pairing and crossing over
2. Sister chromatids remain joined at their centromeres and segregate together during anaphase I
3. Kinetochores of sister chromatids attach to the same pole in meiosis I
4. DNA replication is suppressed between meiosis I and meiosis II

2n = 6
1n = 3

2^3 = 8 possible combinations
2^23 = 8388608 possible combinations

Why reproduce sexually?
> genetic diversity!!
