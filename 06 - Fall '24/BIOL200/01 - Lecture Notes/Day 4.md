Types of bonds:
	Covalent - share a pair of electrons
		polar or nonpolar
	Ionic - opposite charges attract (after a chemical reaction)
	Hydrogen - (Today!)
	Vanderwaals - (Later?)

3 atoms have the following atomic numbers and atomic weights. Which of the following statements is true?

| Atom | Atomic Number | Atomic mass |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| A    | 14            | 30          |
| B    | 16            | 32          |
| C    | 17            | 34          |
	A. They are differently charged ions
	*B. They are atoms of different elements*
	C. They are different isotopes of the same element
	D. They have the same number of electrons.


| Atom | Atomic Number | Atomic mass |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| A    | 16            | 30          |
| B    | 16            | 32          |
| C    | 16            | 34          |
	A. They are differently charged ions
	B. They are atoms of different elements
	*C. They are different isotopes of the same element*
	D. They have the same number of electrons.

Ionic Bonds
- formed by the attraction of oppositely charged *ions*
- loss of electron -> *cation*
- gain of electron -> *anion* 
	- cations+ and anions- are attracted = IONIC BOND

Covalent Bonds
- form when 1 or more pairs of valence electrons are *shared* by 2 atoms

Q. How many covalent bonds would a carbon atom most likely make? Carbon has an atomic # of 6
	A. 4 (4 valence electrons)
	![[Pasted image 20240904092311.png]]

Q. How many covalent bonds would an oxygen atom most likely make? Oxygen has an atomic # of 8
	A. 2 (2 valence electrons)
	![[Pasted image 20240904092521.png]]

Q. In which of the following are the atoms most likely to be held together by ionic bonds?
	A. *LiF*
	B. NH3
	C. CH4
	D. O4
	(look for atoms that are in columns that are far apart on the periodic table)


*Electronegativity*
- defined as an *atom's affinity for electrons*
- Different elements have different amounts of *electronegativity* - upper right corner of periodic table most electronegative

why does it matter?
	bc most organisims are made of CHON!
		Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen!
		ON are more electronegative than CH

Differences in electronegativity dictate how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds
- nonpolar covalent bonds = equal sharing of electrons`
-  polar covalent bonds = unequal sharing of electrons

| Atom | Electronegativity |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| C    | 3.0               |
| H    | 2.1               |
| O    | 3.5               |
| N    | 3.0               |
Polarity and Electronegativity
*nonpolar* covalent bond (e.g. diatomic hydrogen)
- equal electronegativity
- equal sharing
*polar* covalent (e.g., water)
- Oxygen has high electronegativity
- Higher electronegative atom holds the electron more tightly and will have a partial negative charge($\delta$-)
- The other atom will have a partial positive charge ($\delta$ +)

because water is made of a polar covalent bond, we can call water as a molecule polar

![[Pasted image 20240904093935.png]]

Oxygen and Nitrogen are HIGHLY electronegative
Carbon and Hydrogen are NOT AS electronegative

methane is nonpolar because all of its bonds are nonpolar- > electrons are shared equally -> no partial charges -> nonpolar molecule

THIS IS A SUPER IMPORTANT TOPIC, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW IT!!! ^^^^

-------------

Water
- life is inextricably tied to water
- Single most outstanding chemical property of water is its ability to form *hydrogen bonds*
	- weak chemical associations  between the partially negative O atoms and the partially positive H atoms of 2 water molecules

Hydrogen Bonds
- Cohesion - polarity of water allows water molecules to be attracted to one another
- Attraction produces hydrogen bonds
- Each individual bond is weak and transitory
- Cumulative effects are enormous
- Responsible for many of water's important physical properties
