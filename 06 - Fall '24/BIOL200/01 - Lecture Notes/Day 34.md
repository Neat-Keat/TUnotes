# Day 34 ([[11-20-2024]]) 


![[Chapter 12 and 13 Patterns of Inheritance F24.pptx]]

# #Dictionary
- Monohybrid - 1 trait
- Dihibrid - 2 traits (punnett square on Unit 4 exam!!)
- Dominant
- Recessive
# Using a Punnett square to analyze Mendel's cross
Each true-breeding parent makes only one type of gamete
F1 are all purple heterozygotes
- Makes 2 types of gametes and produce 3 kinds of F2 offspring:
	- PP homozygous dominant (purple)
	- Pp heterozygous (also purple)
	- PP homozygous recessive (white)

# Principle of Segregation
Two alleles for a gene segregate during gamete formation (one from each parent) and are rejoined **at random** during fertilization

Physical basis for allele segregation is the **movement of chromosomes during meiosis**

Mendel had no knowledge of chromosomes or meiosis - had not yet been described
- Deduced the principle based on trait ratios
# The Law of Independent Assortment
Law of Segregation 
- follows a single trait-> *monohybrid* cross (e.g., flower color)
Law of Independent Assortment
- Follow two traits -> *dihybrid* cross (e.g., seed color & shape)

Known information about pea plants from Law of Segregation:
- **Yellow** seed allele (Y) is dominant to **green** seed allele (y)
- **Round** seed allele (R) is dominant to **wrinkled** seed allele (r)

If you could cross 2 homozygous plants (YYRR x yyrr), what do you predict would happen? Genotype? Phenotype?
Do the traits always stay together?
- YR and yr?
If so...
- $F_1$ and $F_2$ offspring would still only produce yellow, round seeds to this day
**Doesn't happen! Why not?!
-> we will practice in lab

|     | YR   | YR   | YR   | YR   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| yr  | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr |
| yr  | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr |
| yr  | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr |
| yr  | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr | YyRr |
$F_1$ Is fully heterozygous
phenotype: Yellow & Round

|     | YR   | Yr   | yR   | yr   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| YR  | YYRR | YYRr | YyRR | YyRr |
| Yr  | YYRr | YYrr | YyRr | Yyrr |
| yR  | YyRR | YyRr | yyRR | yyRr |
| yr  | YyRr | Yyrr | yyRr | yyrr |
every box represents a potential fertilization event
Yellow & Round: 9
Yellow & wrinkly: 3
green & Round: 3
green & wrinkly: 1

# 2 pairs of alleles segregate independently-
- Encoded on ==two different chromosomes==
- The presence of one specific allele for one trait ==has no impact== on the presence of a specific allele for the second trait
$F_1$ offspring -> yellow, round seeds.
$F_1$ gametes -> all possible allelic combinations
- ==YR, Yr, yR, and yr== would be produced in equal amounts

# Dihybrid crosses
- *Dihybrid* cross used to study two variations of two traits in a single cross
- Mendel produced true-breeding lines, each with two traits
- R R Y Y x r r y y (Round Yellow x wrinkled green)
- The $F_1$ generation of a dihybrid cross (Rr Yy) shows only the dominant phenotypes for each trait
- Allow $F_1$ to self-fertilize to produce $F_2$ 

# Dihybrid crosses produce a 9:3:3:1 ratio
$F_1$ self-fertilizes to produce $F_2$
R r Y y x R r Y y

The $F_2$ generation shows all four possible phenotypes in a set ratio
- 9:3:3:1
- (R_ Y_):(R_yy):(rr Y_):(rr yy) - underscore represents dominant or recessive allele
- (round yellow):(round green):(wrinkled yellow):(wrinkled green)

# Principle of Independent Assortment
- in a dihybrid cross, the alleles of each gene assort independently
- the segregation of different allele pairs is independent - for example seed shape is independent of seed color
- independent alignment of different homologous chromosome pairs during metaphase I leads to the independent segregation of the different allele pairs

Q. Which of the following organisms would be considered homozygous for all three of the genes indicated?
A. AAbbCC

Q. Which of the following genotypes would be true breeding for the trait controlled by the A/a gene?
A. AA (and aa)

Q. Towson Tigers have a gene that controls whisker length. That gene has two alleles. The S allele is dominant and codes for short whiskers. The s allele is recessive and codes for long whiskers. A tiger from a true breeding strain of tigers with short whiskers is mated to a tiger from a true breeding strain with long whiskers. What are the genotypes of the two tigers?
A. Long = ss, Short = SS

Q. What gametes will each tiger produce?
A. Long = s, Short = S

|     | s   | s   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S   | Ss  | Ss  |
| S   | Ss  | Ss  |
Q. $F_2$ generation?
A. 1/4 SS, 1/2 Ss, 1/4 ss

|     | S   | s   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S   | SS  | Ss  |
| s   | Ss  | ss  |
|     |     |     |
# Testcross

How can you tell the genotype of an individual expressing the dominant phenotype?
Testcross is used to determine the genotype of an individual with unknown phenotype
Cross the unknown genotype (ex P_) with a homozygous recessive (pp)
Phenotypic ratios among offspring are different, depending on the genotype of the unknown parent
- Ratios will indicate what the genotype of the unknown individual was.

# Extensions to Mendel
Mendel's model of inheritance assumes that
- each trait is controlled by a single gene
- each gene has only two alleles
- there is a clear dominant-recessive relationship between the alleles
Most genes do not meet these criteria!

# Environmental influence
Environment does effect phenotype
*Phenotypic plasticity* refers to different phenotypes from same genotype due to environmental conditions
Coat color in Himalayan rabbits and Siamese cats
- Allele produces an enzyme that allows pigment production only at temperatures below 30C

# Continuous variation
Many traits show *continuous variation* which refers to a range of possible phenotypes across genotypes
Often, the phenotype is the result of an accumulation of contributions by multiple genes
These traits show continuous variation and are referred to as *quantitative traits*
- More common than traits due to single genes.

# Polygenetic inheritance
Occurs when multiple genes are involved in controlling the phenotype of a trait
The phenotype is an accumulation of contributions by multiple genes
These traits show continuous variation and are referred to as *quantitative traits*
- ex. human height
- Histogram shows normal distribution
