Flow of energy in Living Systems
- thermodynamics
	- branch of chemistry concerned with energy changes
- cells are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry
- understanding laws of thermodynamics is crucial to understanding how cells function

# Energy Flow
* Energy flows into the biological world from the sun
* Photosynthetic organisms capture this energy
* Stored as potential energy in chemical bonds
* Breaking bonds between atoms requires energy; energy stored in chemical bonds may be used to make new bonds

** Covalent Bonds = Potential Energy **


# Redox Reactions
- Oxidation
	- atom or molecule loses an electron
- Reduction
	- Atom or molecule gains an electron
	- Higher level of energy than oxidized form
- Oxidation-reduction reactions (redox)
	- reactions always paired

#MEMORIZE OILRIG
	Oxidation Is Loss,
	Reduction Is Gain
![[Pasted image 20241007091334.png]]

loss of electron -> lower energy
gain of electron -> higher energy

# Laws of Thermodynamics

* First law of thermodynamics states that *energy cannot be created or destroyed*

	- Energy can only change from one form to another
	- Total amount of energy in the universe remains constant
	- During each conversion, some energy is lost as heat
	- Energy available in the universe to do work decreases as more of it is progressively lost as heat

* Second law of thermodynamics states that *entropy (disorder) is continuously increasing*

	- Energy transformations proceed spontaneously to convert matter from a more ordered/less stable form to a less ordered/ more stable form
	- When universe formed, it held all the potential energy it will ever have; has become progressively more disordered ever since

# How Do Chemical Reactions Happen?
- *Chemical Reactions* have *reactants* and *productions*
	- ex: $$ CO_2 + H_2O <-> H_2CO_3 $$
- *Chemical equilibrium ($\Delta$G = 0):*
	- forward and reverse reactions proceed at the same rate
	- quantities of reactants and products remain constant
- *Endergonic reactions* require energy (or heat) to proceed; are non-spontaneous: $\Delta$G > 0
- *Exergonic reactions*: release energy (or heat), are spontaneous:: $\Delta$G < 0

# Entropy is a measure of DISORDER
less order = greater entropy


# Free Energy (G)
- Definition
- Contributors
	- H = Enthalpy (total energy or potential energy)
		- increases free energy
	- S = Entropy
		- decreases free energy
		- temperature
	- G = H - TS
		(dont need to memorize formula lol)
- G = Energy available to do work
	- (G stands for Gibbs free energy)
- G = H – TS
	- H = enthalpy, total energy contained in a molecule’s chemical bonds
	- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)
	- S = entropy, unavailable energy

# $\Delta$G = $\Delta$H - T$\Delta$S
- $\Delta$G = change in free energy
- Positive - $\Delta$G
	- products have more free energy than reactants
	- H is higher or S is lower
	- Not spontaneous, requires input of energy
	- Endergonic
- Negative - $\Delta$G
	- products have less free energy than reactants
	- H is lower or S is higher or both
	- Spontaneous (may not be instantaneous)
	- Exergonic

Final - initial = deltaG
# Enthalpy
- total energy (bond energy)
- increases with size
- non-polar bonds = higher energy

Q. Which of the following would have the greatest enthalpy?
	A. CH4
	B. C2H4
	C. *C6H14*
	D. All would be equal

![[Pasted image 20241007093512.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241007093528.png]]
$\Delta$G = 8 - 15 = -7
-7 < 0
$\therefore$ Exergonic

![[Pasted image 20241007093742.png]]

If all chemical reactions that release free energy tend to occur spontaneously, why haven't all such reactions already occurred?
Spontaneous =/ Instantaneous

# Activation Energy
- *Extra energy required to destabilize existing bonds and initiate a chemical reaction*
- Exergonic reaction's rate depends on the activation energy required
	- Larger activation energy = proceeds more slowly
- Rate of reaction can be increased 2 ways
	1. Increasing energy of reacting molecules (heating)
	2. Lowering activation energy

![[Pasted image 20241007094015.png]]
#MEMORIZE ^^^ could be a test question
# Catalysts
- substances that influence chemical bonds in a way that *lowers activation energy*
- Cannot violate laws of thermodynamics
	- cannot make an endergonic reaction spontaneous
	- can only make an exergonic reaction proceed more quickly
- Do not alter the proportion of reactant turned into product
- Catalysts themselves are NOT used up in reaction
- in living systems, *enzymes* are catalysts

# Enzymes: Biological Catalysts
- most enzymes are globular proteins
	- some are RNA
- Shape of enzyme stabilizes a temporary association between substrates (aka reactants)
- Enzyme not changed or consumed in reaction - can be used over and over again
- Ex: Carbonic anhydrase
	- 200 molecules of carbonic acid per hour made without enzyme
	- 600,000 molecules formed per second with enzyme

![[Pasted image 20241007094837.png]]

Enzymes are HIGHLY specific, typically only work with one reaction
