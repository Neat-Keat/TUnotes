Start of ch 10!

# Outline
- Bacterial Cell Division
- Eukaryotic Chromosome Structure
- Overview of Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
- Interphase
- M phase
- Cell Cycle Regulation and Cancer

# Brainstorm!
what are the major issues cells need to deal with in order to divide? (i.e. make identical copies of themselves?)
- copy genetic material (DNA replication)
	- happens in S phase
- need source of new molecules = Growth

# What happens in mitosis?

- replication and division of DNA
- division of cells -> 2 clonal (identical) cells
	- 1 "parent", 1 "daughter"
- Cytokinesis = separation into 2 cells

![[Pasted image 20241030090556.png]]
- Functions
	- growth of organism; wound repair
	- asexual reproduction

> Mitosis produces identical daughter cells
# Bacterial Cell Division
- Bacteria divide by *binary fission*
	- no sexual life cycle
	- reproduction is clonal
- Single, circular bacterial chromosome is replicated
- Replication begins at the origin of replication and proceeds in 2 directions to site of termination
- New chromosomes are partitioned to opposite ends of the cell
- Septum forms to divide the cell into 2 cells

Septation //Dont need to know lol
- production of septum separates cell's other compartments
- begins with formation of ring of FtsZ proteins
- accumulation of other proteins follow
- Structure contracts radially to pinch cell in two
- FtsZ protein found in most prokaryotes
- FtsZ has structural similarity to eukaryotic tubulin

# Eukaryotic Chromosomes
- Every species has a different number of chromosomes in their somatic cells (10-50 typically)
- humans have *46 chromosomes* in *23 nearly identical pairs* #MEMORIZE
	- additional/missing chromosomes usually fatal

| Prokaryotes           | Eukaryotes              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1 Circular chromosome | Many linear chromosomes |
| (small)               | Vary but LARGE          |

^^ dont need to memorize, just know its different per species
	also know that # of chromosomes is NOT correlated to complexity
# Karyotype
- Particular array of chromosomes in an individual organism
	- arranged according to size, staining properties, location of centromere, etc
- humans are diploid (2n)
	- 2 complete sets of 23 chromosomes
	- 46 total chromosomes
- Haploid (n) - 1 set of chromosomes
	- 23 in humans
- Pair of chromosomes are homologous
	- each one in a homologue

![[Pasted image 20241030091742.png]]
note:
- theyre condensed, 
- the XY chromosome means its a boy!
- the chromosomes have constrictions
	- these are called *centromeres* #MEMORIZE
	- on other sides of the centromeres are called arms

how much DNA does each chromosome have?
	avg size = 140 million nucleotides -> 4.3 cm long
# Chromosomes
- composed of *chromatin* - complex of *DNA* and *protein* (40% DNA, 60% protein)
- DNA of a single chromosome is one long continuous double-stranded fiber
- RNA is associated with chromosomes during RNA synthesis
- a typical human chromosome 140 million nucleotides long
	- stretched out would be 4.3 cm long!
	- they're folded up a LOT
- In the non-dividing nucleus
	- Heterochromatin - not expressed (theyre compacted!)
	- Euchromatin - expressed

Chromo- = color (and also kind of body)


# PROBLEM!
- how do cells fit all that DNA into the nucleus, replicate it, and then make sure it gets accurately divided between 2 daughter cells?
- CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE = MULTIPLE LEVELS OF COMPACTION + CONNECTIVITY

# Chromosome Structure
- Nucleosome
	- complex of DNA and histone proteins
	- Promote and guide coiling of DNA
	- DNA duplex coiled around 8 histone proteins every 150 nucleotides
	- Histones are positively charged and strongly attracted to negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA (one of the only things thats +, plays well with the negative DNA)
TLDR: DNA is wrapped around histones

# Chromatin is Spatially Organized
Chromatin is organized into territories
	territories contain individual chromosomes
Compartments exist within each chromosome
formed by TADs (topologically associated domains)

![[Pasted image 20241030092245.png]]

each chromosome has an address (territory) in the nucleus through biology magic!
# TADs
Topologically associated domains
Loops of DNA in nucleosomes
Anchored by 22 proteins
	- CTCF: a DNA-binding protein
	- Cohesins
Organization may affect the control of gene expression
- Heterochromatin
	- not active, more highly condensed
- Euchromatin
	- Active, less condensed

# Chromosomal Condensation
Condensation varies throughout the cell cycle

Familiar X-Shaped mitotic chromosomes are arranged around scaffold of protein to achieve maximum compaction

TADs disappear during prophase
- more regular interactions occur
- SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins interact with the DNA
	- condensin replaces cohesin

DNA appears to be more fluid

# One New Model
Cohesion proteins are organized along the scaffold

ATP is used to form regular loops of DNA in nucleosomes
- further twisted to compact the loops

DNA is wrapped into nucleosomes

Interactions of linker histones, and the nucleosomes themselves can change the density of the "liquid DNA"

# Replication of Chromosomes
- before replication: chromosome = single DNA molecule
- after replication: chromosome = 2 identical DNA molecules
	- held together by *cohesin* proteins
- Visible as 2 strands held together at centromere as chromosome becomes more coondensed

- One chromosome composed of 2 identical sister *chromatids* #MEMORIZE
