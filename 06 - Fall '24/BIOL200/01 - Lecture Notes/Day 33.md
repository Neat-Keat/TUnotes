# Day 33 ([[11-18-2024]]) 

as much genetics as we can this week
we have class next monday
after break, 1 week + 1 day of gene expression and an exam
new smartbooks posted
- [ ] #BIOL200 quiz due W

look back at unit 1
bc final is cumulative and early

extra credit final exam review stuff will be posted
be comfortable with ch14 and 1st 2 units

you are responsible for ch11 & ch 12 & as much of 13 as we get through

# Dictionary terms today:
- True-breeding
- Homozygous
- Heterozygous
- Dominant
- Recessive
- Phenotype Ratio

# Heredity and Family Resemblance

### Genetic Diversity Sources
1. Mutation
2. Crossing Over = Prophase I
3. random alignment of maternal and paternal homologues on Metaphase I spindle

we tend to resemble those we're more closely related to 
	but not always lolol

# Mystery of heredity
- Before the 20th century, 2 concepts were the basis for ideas about heredity
	- heredity occurs within species
	- traits are transmitted directly from parent to offspring
- Thought traits were borne through fluid (ex. blood) and blended in offspring (where the term "bloodline" comes from!)
- Paradox - if blending occurs why don't all individuals look alike?

# Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
- Lots of training
	- Augustine monk
	- Beekeeper
	- Physics Teacher
	- Meteorologist
- Monastery garden
	- Pea plants
- Science Taxes

Wrote "Experiments on Plant Hybridization"
- published in 1866
	- before 20th century, cited 3 times
	- ...

# Mendel and the Gene Idea
- What he knew:
	- Heritable variations exist
	- traits are transmitted from parents to offspring
- 2 main theories existed
	- Blending (mixing of traits)
	- particulate inheritance (direct passage of one trait over another)
- Where he started:
	- documented particulate inheritance with garden peas (Pisum sativum)

# Gregor Mendel ctd
Quantified results of his experiments using pea plants
Pea plants were optimal because:
1. Other research showed that pea hybrids could be produced
2. Many pea varieties were available
3. Peas are small plants and easy to grow
4. Peas can self-fertilize or be cross-fertilized


# Peas are Awesome Genetic Models in the 1860s
Lots of visible traits
controlled mating
Hermaphroditic
- sperm-producing organs (stamens) and egg-producing organs (carpels)

Cross-pollination (fertilization between different plants) can be done intentionally

# Mendel's experiment method

Usually in 3 stages
1. Produce true-breeding strains for each trait he was studying (they are homozygous)
2. Cross-fertilize true-breeding strains having alternate forms of a trait
	1. also perform *reciprocal crosses* to ensure source of pollen is from both types (for example white and puruple)
3. Allow the hybrid offspring to self-fertilize for several generations and **Count** the number of offspring showing each form of the trait

# Monohybrid crosses

*monohybrid crosses*
...
...


# $F_1$ Generation

$F_1$ = first filial generation

offspring produced by crossing two true-breeding strains

for every trait Mendel studied, all $F_1$ plants resembled same parent (for example purple flower)

- Referred to visible trait as *dominant*
- alternative trit (ex. white flower) was *recessive*

No plants with intermediate characteristics of parents were produced, meaning no blending inheritance

Experiment
------
P Generation  (true-breeding parents)
	purple flowers x white flowers
			|
			v
$F_1$ generation (hybrids!)
	all plants had purpple flowers

$F_2$ generation
...
...

# 3:1 is actuall 1:2:1
$F_2$ plants
	3/4 plants with the dominant form
	1/4 plants with the recessive form
	the dominant to recessive ratio was 3:1
Mendel discovered the ratio is actually:
- 1 true-breeding dominant plant
- 2 not-true-breeding dominant plant
- 1 ... recessive plant

# Conclusions
His plants did not show intermediate traits
- each trait was intact, discrete
for each pair, one trait was dominant, the other recessive
pairs of alternative traits examined were segregated among the progeny of a particular cross 
...

# Mendels 5-element $model_1$
1. Parent transmit discrete factors (genes)
2. each individual receives one copy of a gene from each parent
3. not all copies of a gene are identical
	1. allele - alternative form of a gene
	2. homozygous - 2 of the same allele
	3. heterozygous - different alleles
4. Alleles remain discrete - no blending
5. Presence of allele does not guarantee expression
	1. dominant allele - expressed
	2. recessive allele - hidden by dominant allele

* *Genotype* - an individua
* *Phenotype* - ...

# Principle of Segregation
Two alleles for a gene segregate during gamete formation (one from each parent) and are rejoined **AT RANDOM** during fertilization

Physical basis for allele segregation is the **movement of chromosomes during meiosis**

Mendel had no knowledge of chromosomes or meiosis - had not been described
- deduced the principle based on trait ratios

# Useful Genetic Vocabulary
- Homozygous: 2 identical alleles for a trait (==RR / rr==)
	- "homozygous dominant" or "homozygous recessive"
- Heterozygous: two different alleles for a trait (==Rr==)
	- "Heterozygous for ... " -> carrier

An organism's expressed traits **DO NOT ALWAYS** reveal its genetic composition!
- Phenotype: physical appearance (==purple flowers==)
- Genotype: genetic makeup (==Pp==)

- In the example of flower color in pea plants, ==PP== and ==Pp== plants have the same ==phenotype== (purple), but **different genotypes**

# Using a Punnett square to analyze Mendel's cross
Each true-breeding parent makes only one type of gamete
F1 are all purple heterozygotes
- Make 2 types of gametes and produce 3 kinds of $F_2$ offspring:
	- PP homozygous dominant (purple)
	- Pp heterozygous (also purple)
	- PP homozygous recessive (white)
> Gametes are Haploid!!

parents are P generation, products are $F_1$ generation

|     | p   | p   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P   | Pp  | Pp  |
| P   | Pp  | Pp  |

parents are $F_1$ generation, products are $F_2$ generation

phenotypic ratio is 3:1
genotypic ratio is 1:2:1
