### Running list of terms today:
- DNA Polymerase
	- an enzyme that makes a DNA polymer (makes a strand of DNA)
- RNA Polymerase
	- an enzyme that makes an RNA polymer (makes a strand of RNA)
- Origin of Replication
- Exonuclease
	- breaks down nucleic acids (their phosphodiester bonds!) from the 3' end (proofreading!)
- Helicase
	- breaks down a helix (DNA!!)
- Replication bubble
- Replication Fork
- DNA Pol III
- DNA Pol I


0) Origin
1) Helicase
2) SSB
3) Gyrase (a topoisomerase)
4) Primase
5) DNA Pol III
# DNA Replication
- requires 3 things
	1. something to copy
		- parental DNA molecule
		- called the templatee
	2. Something to do the copying
		- enzymes
	3. Building blocks to make copy
		- nucleotide triphosphates

DNA replication includes:
- *Initiation* - replication begins
- *Elongation* - new strands of DNA are synthesized by DNA polymerase
- *Termination* - replication is terminated

DNA Polymerase attaches to the free 3' OH end of the DNA molecule

how does DNA polymerase "know" to add the right nucleotide  {C, T, A, G} to match the complimentary base pair of the other helix?


![[Pasted image 20241108093321.png]]

5' end has the phosphate group
3' end has the OH group
	DNA polymerase recognizes the OH
	needs the double strand to already be partially started before it can add on

* DNA Polymerases
	* matches existing DNA bases with complementary nucleotides and links them
	* All have several common features
		* add new bases to 3' end of existing strands
		* ***Synthesize in 5'-to-3' Direction*** #MEMORIZE 
		* Require a Primer of DNA

# Prokaryotic Replication

* E. coli model
* Single circular molecule of DNA
* Replication begins at **one** ....
* ...
* ...

1 origin of rplication, copy around the circle in both directions, end with 2 tangles circle!

# E. coli has 3 DNA polymerases
DNA polymerase I (Pol I)
- Acts on lagging strand to remove primers and replace them with DNA
DNA polymerase II (Pol II)
- involved in DNA repair processes
DNA polymerase III (Pol III)
- main replication enzyme

All have 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity - proofreading
DNA Pol I has 5'-to-3' exonuclease activity - removing RNA primers

# DNA polymerase activity
...

# Enzymes unwind DNA
Step 1: separate the two strands
	DNA is super stable bc of all of its Hydrogen bonds
	need an enzyme!
	
- Helicases - use energy from ATP to unwind 
- Single-strand-binding proteins (SSBs) coat strands to keep them apart
- Unwinding of DNA introduces torsional strain in the molecule that can lead to additional twisting of the helix, called *supercoiling*
- *Topoisomerases* are enzymes that prevent supercoiling
	- *DNA gyrase* is the topoisomerase involved in DNA replication that relieves the torsional strain

Recall the lanyard demo

Recall isomers are molecules with the same molecules arranged in a different way

# Replication
![[Pasted image 20241108093626.png]]

DNA polymerases cant start a new strand on their own, they need a primer!!
- from primase!
