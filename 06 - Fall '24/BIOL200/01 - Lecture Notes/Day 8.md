test on 1, 2, 3 and as much as 5 as we cover
	on a scantron!

review nucleic acids today, and then cover proteins
	monomer/polymer relationship, etc
lipids next week

all of ch5 smartbooks due next tuesday

---------

Hierchy starting with simplest
A. Proton < Hydrogen < Ribose Sugar < Nucleotide < RNA

How is genetic info stored in DNA?
A. The sequence of nucleotides

As you raise the temperature of a solution containing DNA, which of the following is most likely to happen first?
A. The two strands of DNA will become separated from each other

Complement to 5'ATTGCTGAGAG 3'?
A.                              3' TAACGACTCTC 5' (note the antiparallelism)
flipped to be        5' CTCTCAGCAAT 3'
if ends are NOT labeled, you assume its 5' ->3'

Which RNA is complementary to 5' ATTGCTGAGAG 3'
A.                                                                   3' UAACGACUCUC 5'
                flipped to be    5' CUCUCAGCAAU 3


Proteins!
----------

Proteins are the most diverse group of biological macromolecules, both chemically and functionally!

Protein Functions Include:
1. *Enzyme catalysis* - enzymes facilitate specific chemical reactions (PRIMARILY)
2. *Defense* - against invaders/ recognize self
3. *Transport* - small molecules and ions
4. *Support/Structure* - collagen
5. *Motion* - muscle contraction
6. *Regulation* - hormones; control of gene expression
7. *Storage* - ion-binding (iron, calcium)

Amino acids: The building blocks of proteins
- proteins are linear polymers of *amino acids*
	- Monomer = amino acid
	- Polymer = polypeptide
- 20 common protein-encoding amino acids
	- Central carbon (C)
	- Amino group (NH2)
	- Carboxyl Group (COOH)
	- One functional and variable side group ("R")

![[Pasted image 20240913094514.png]]
highlighted part is the R Group
	see if its polar or nonpolar
	Know the 3 categories
	CH -> nonpolar
	ON -> polar (overrides being nonpolar)
	- or + charge = ionic

carbs:
-store energy
-structure

neither carbs nor proteins store info
	DNA does!
