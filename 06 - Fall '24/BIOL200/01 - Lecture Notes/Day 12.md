-------------

the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration is -
A. Diffusion

Permeability refers to -
A. The extent a membrane allows a substance to pass through

components of the membrane: #MEMORIZE
- phospholipid bilayer
	- heads hydrogen bond to the water
	- tails are hydrophobically excluded
- cholesterol
	- maintains membrane fluidity
- transmembrane proteins
- cell surface markers
	- glycoprotein
	- glycolipid
- peripheral proteins

Membrane proteins
Various functions:
1. transporters
2. enzymes
3. cell-surface receptors
4. cell-surface identity markers
5. cell-to-cell adhesion proteins
6. attachments to the cytoskeleton
7. affect membrane structure

integral membrane proteins
- span the lipid bilayer (transmembrane proteins)
	- nonpolar regions of the protein are embedded in the interior of the bilayer
	- polar regions of the protein protrude from both sides of the bilayer
- Transmembrane domain
	- spans the lipid bilayer
	- hydrophobic amino acids arranged in a helices

how do transmembrane proteins get there? how do they stay there?
	recall R groups!
		the middle section of the $\alpha$ helix is made up of non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids
		the only R groups that can tolerate water are polar OR charged amino acids

Q. Why is Fe+ not able to move directly through the membrane? #MEMORIZE
	A. It carries a charge & it is hydrophilic
(recall the phospholipid bilayer is almost entirely impermeable to ions)

Q. Which is the correct ranking of the following in terms of permeability through a phospholipid bilayer?
	A. CH4 > C2H6 > C6H14 (recall the 2 factors are electronegativity and size!)

WHich is the correct ranking of the following in terms of solubbility (ability to pass) through a phospholipid bilayer)
	A. C6H14 > C6H14O > C6H12O6

Osmosis - A special Case of Diffusion
- differenct concentrations of solute on either side of membrane
	- membrane that is permeable to water, but not to the solutes
- water spontaneously moves
![[Pasted image 20240925092240.png]]
Osmosis - net diffusion of water across a membrane toward a higher solute concentration #MEMORIZE 

When 2 solutions have different osmotic concentrations:
- Hypertonic solution = higher solute concentration
- Hypotonic solution = lower solute concentration
- Isotonic solution = same osmotic concentration

A cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Which way will the water move?
	A. Into the cell

Passive transport
is the movement of molecules through the membrane in which
	- no energy is required
	- molecules move in response to a concentration gradient (from high to low)
Diffusion is movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration
- will continue until the concentration is the same in all regions

facilitated diffusion
- molecules that cannot cross membrane easily may move through proteins
- move from high to low[]
- channel proteins
	- hydrophilic channel when open
- carrier proteins
	- bind specifically to molecules they assist
Membrane is selectively permeable

 green is hydrophilic

Active Transport
- requires energy - ATP is used directly or indirectly to fuel active transport
- moves substances from low to high[] (against the concentration gradient)
- requires the use of highly selective carrier proteins

Think of the slide analogy and how it relates to [] gradients

Sodium-Potassium (Na+/K+) pump
- Direct use of ATP for active transport
- uses an antiporter to move 3 Na+ out of the cell and 2 K+ into the cell
	- Movement is against their concentration gradient
- ATP is used to change the conformation of the carrier protein
- Affinity of the carrier protein for either Na+ or K+ changes so ions can be carried across the membrane\

see animation
phosphate groups are negatively charged, which is what changes the shape of the pump, allowing Na+ to leave pump
once K+ enters from the outside, the P group leaves

| Passive            | Active |

| No input of energy |        |
| from high to low[] |        |
