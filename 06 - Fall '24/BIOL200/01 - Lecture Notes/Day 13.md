quiz this weekend on ch5

----------

sodium potassium pump is V important in animal cells
	keeps high concentration of sodium on one, and high [] of potassium on another
	requires ATP to function
ATP is the energy currency of the cell
	Adenosine Triphosphate
	an RNA of 3 A's (like the one in DNA!!)

how do the 3 P groups stay together?

hydrolysis is cleaving by adding water
	in ATP, its between each Phosphate group

key points:
1. active transport mechanism
	1. energy required
	2. moves molecules high[] to low

gradients represent a kind of potential energy
	like water behind a dam

--------
Bulk transport
- Endocytosis
	- requires energy
	- movement of substances into the cell
	- *Phagocytosis* - cell takes in particulate matter
	- *Pinocytosis* - cell takes in only fluid
	- receptor-mediated endocytosis - specific molecules are taken in after they bind to a receptor
- Exocytosis
	- movement of substances out of the cell
	- requires energy

a third kind we wont be tested on:
![[Pasted image 20240927091840.png]]

-------
Exocytosis
- discharge of materials out of the cell
- used in plants to export cell wall material
- used in animals to secrete hormones, neurotransmitters, digestive enzymes

Practice Qs:

Q. what happens to a membrane with 1M valine if placed in a solution of 1M leucine (both are impermeable (based on amino acids!))
	A. no net osmosis would occur (Isotonic, even with different solutes)

note: Molarity = 1 mole/Liter -> [] is NOT dependant on the amount of water its dissolved in
	recall a mole is 6.02 * 10^23 molecules of any substance!

Q. what type of amino acids would you find in the transmembrane portion of a membrane protein?
	A. Non-polar amino acids #MEMORIZE 

Q. What happens to a membrane vesicle containing pure water when placed in a 1M solution of valine?
	A. Osmosis would make water flow from the vesicle to the outside (low[] to high[])

Q. pure water into 1M leucine?
	A. shrink bc of osmosis

note equilibrium wont ever actually be reached here

Q. 1M leucine into pure water?
	A. Burst bc of osmosis
	note that a cell wall *could* resist osmotic forces

Q. What happens to a PLANT CELL with 1M valine if placed into pure water?
	A. it would swell due to osmosis (NO BURSTING BC OF CELL WALL)
		demo on watering "dead" celery

Q. What would happen if you watered your houseplant with salt water instead of fresh water?
	A. It would wilt
		water will leave the roots towards the higher concentration

whats NOT an ex of passive transport?
	A. Sodium being transported out of the cell by the NA/K pump
		note diffusion is ALWAYS passive

Q. What happens to the rate of NA+ transport out of a cell by the pump if you added an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis?
	A. it would slow/stop, bc the pump needs energy to function

Ch4. Cell Structure (comes with extra credit this weekend!)

![[Pasted image 20240927093957.png]]

need to have a very distinct understanding of the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes


Cells - Size, Structure, Function
	- differ in size
	- differ in complexity
	- structure correlates to function

![[Pasted image 20240927094143.png]]

Cells
- cells were discovered in 1665 by Robert Hooke
	- what was he looking at?
- Early studies of cells were conducted by
	- Mathias Schleiden (1838)
	- Theodor Schwann (1839)

dont need to know names!

Modern Cell Theory!
1. All organisms are composed of 1 or more cells
2. Cells are the smallest living things (basic units of organization of all organisms)
3. Cells arise ONLY from pre-existing cells
	1. all cells today represent a continuous line of descent from the first living cells

know that cells have to be small so that diffusion is fast and easy


Structures found in ALL cells #MEMORIZE (could be a Q on the back of the exam)
1. Nucleoid or nucleus where DNA is located
2. Cytoplasm
	1. semifluid matrix of organelles and cytosol
3. Ribosomes
	1. synthesize proteins
4. Plasma membrane
	1. phospholipid bilayer
