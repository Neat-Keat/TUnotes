# Day 31 ([[13]]) 

![[Ch 14 Nucleic Acids, DNA replication F24.pptx]]

one last comment from DNA replication and repair, then jump to meiosis and genetics

# DNA Repair
- Errors due to replication
	- DNA  polymerases have proofreading ability
- Mutagens - any agent that increases the number of mutations above background level
	- Radiation and chemicals
- Importance of DNA repair is indicated by the multiplicity of repair systems that have been discovered

> understand that even tho the goal of DNA replication is to copy DNA exactly, there has to be some underlying variation in DNA in a population so that evolution has something to act upon
- means pop cant be static
- we want a low enough number of mutations to prevent individual death, but enough to provide genetic variation to a population

## Photorepair

nonfunctional enzyme in humans D:

# Excision repair
- nonspecific repair
- damaged region is removed and replaced by DNA synthesis
- 3 steps
	- recognition of damage
	- removal of the damaged region
	- resynthesis using the information on the undamaged strand as a template

# Ch11 Meiosis

Mitosis and meiosis generally go together, but they're separated in lecture to help us learn better

# Outline
- Terminology
- Sexual life cycle
- process of meiosis
- meiosis vs mitosis

# Cell types
- 3 main classifications of cells
	- Somatic cells //soma = body -> all the cells of your body
		- diploid
		- divide by mitosis
	- Germ cells //cells from which gametes are derived (eggs and sperm)
		- diploid
		- divide only by meiosis to produce gametes
	- Gametes (haploid products of germ cells)
		- haploid
		- sex cells

Haploid - n - 23 in humans
Diploid - 2n  - 46 in humans

3 good slides about differences between somatic, germ, and gametes

> chant "gametes are haploid" all week

# Fertilization
- the union of the nucleus of a sperm cell with nucleus of an egg cell, producing a zygote
...
...

somatic - 46
germ - 46
gametes - 23

how does meiosis happen?

# Sexual life cycle
- made up of *meiosis* and *fertilization*
- diploid cells (2n))
	- somatic cells of adults have 2 sets of chromosomes
- haploid cells (1n)
	- gametes have only 1 set of chromosomes

# Gene arrangement
- homologous chromosomes
	- chromosomes of the same pair
- genes
	- section of DNA that encode proteins
	- hereditary traits
- Alleles
	- different versions of a specific gene

Homologous chromosomes carry the same genes in the same locations, but each one may contain different alleles

# overview of meiosis
- 2 sets of cell divisions
	- meiosis I - separation of homologues in each chromosome pair - each chromosome still consists of two identical sister chromatids
- meiosis II - separation of sister chromatids of each chromosome

- Daughter cell number
	- meiosis -> 4 new cells
	- mitosis -> 2 new cells
- Each daughter  cell has only half as many chromosomes as the parent cell (2N -> 1N)

mitosis = 2 identical diploid cells
meiosis = 4 nonidentical gametes

# Features of Meiosis
- Meiosis includes *2* rounds of division
	- meiosis I and ...
	- ...
- ...

# Features of Meiosis
- first meiotic division
- ...
- ...

# Synapsis
- the physical pairing of the homologues
- see picture from slides
	- homologues held together by the synaptonemal complex

# The process of Meiosis
- meiotic cells have an interphase period that is similar to mitosis with G1, S, and G2 phases
- ...
- ...
- ...
# Meiosis I
- Prophase I
	- chromosomes coil tighter and become visible, nuclear envelope disappears, spindle forms
	- each chromosome is composed of two sister chromatids
	- synapsis
		- sites of crossing over form
		## Crossing over
		- genetic recombination between nonsister chromatids
		- allows the homologues to exchange chromosomal material
		- alleles of genes that were formerly on separate homologues can now be found on the same homologue
		- Chiasmata - site of crossing over
			- contact maintained until anaphase I
		- see pic in slides
		- happens between non-sister chromatids
- Metaphase I
	- paired homologues locked together following crossing over
	- microtubules from opposite poles attach to each homologue
		- *DO NOT* attach to each sister chromatid as in mitosis
	- homologues are aligned at the metaphase plate side-by-side
	- orientation of each pair of homologues on the spindle is ...
- Anaphase I
	- microtubules of the spindle shorted
		- chiasamata break
	- homologues are separated from each other and move to opposite poles
		- sister chromatids ....
		- ...
		- ...
- Telophase I
	- nuclear envelope re-forms around each daughter nucleus
		- homologous chromosomes are separated
	- sister chromatids are no longer identical due to crossing over
	- Cytokinesis may or may not occur after telophase I
	- Meiosis II occurs after an interval of variable length

> Meiosis I is a reductional division. The cells are haploid already at the end of division
