extra credit opportunity is due "sometime next week, im gonna go with wednesday"
	"is super important"

look into Hank Green's "Eukaryopolis"

on the exams:
	range: 100% - 20%
	mean in the 60s

Endosymbiosis:

a cell engulfed by phagocytosis ate another cell that was able to perform cellular respiration

the microtubule's arguably most important function is its role in mitosis, as seen above!

What role does the cytoskeleton play in complex cellular processes?
- cells need to interact with their environment
- change shape and move from place to place
- grow, divide, respond to extracellular signals
- pull chromosomes apart at mitosis
- drive intracellular traffic
- allows sperm to swim
- white blood cells to crawl across surfaces
- muscles to contract

# Centrosomes
- region surrounding centrioles in almost all animal cells
- centrioles are barrel-shaped organelles
- microtubule-organizing center
	- can nucleate the assembly of microtubules
- animal cells and most protists have centrioles - pair of organelles
- plants and fungi usually lack centrioles

# Cell Movement
- essentially all cell motion is tied to the movement of actin filaments, microtubules, or both
- some cells *crawl* using actin microfilaments and myosin motor proteins
- flagella and cilia have 9+2 arrangement of microtubules
	- NOT like prokaryotic flagella
	- cilia are shorter and more numerous

# Extracellular Matrix (ECM)
- animal cells lack cell walls
- secrete an elaborate mixture of glycoproteins into the space around them
- collagen may be abundant
- form a protective layer over the cell surface
- integrins link ECM to cell's cytoskeleton
	- influence cell behavior

be able to compare stuff in pro vs eukaryotes -> stuff in plants and animals 

# Cell-to-Cell interactions
- surface proteins give cells identity
	- cells make contact, "read" each other, and react
	- glycolipids - most tissue-specific cell surface markers
	- MHC proteins - recognition of "self" and "nonself" cells by the immune system

# Cell Connections
3 Categories based on Function:
1. Tight junction
	1. connect the plasma membranes of adjacent cells in a sheet - no leakage
2. Anchoring junction
	1. mechanically attaches cytoskeletons of neighboring cells (desmosomes)
3. Communicating junction
	1. chemical or electrical signal passes directly from one cell to an adjacent one (gap junction, plasmodesmata)

# Start of Ch 6!!

# Flow of Energy in Living Systems
- Thermodynamics
	- branch of chemistry concerned with energy changes
- Cells are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry
- understanding laws of thermodynamics is crucial to understanding how cells function

- Energy flows into the biological world from the sun (-> *How much???*)
- Photosynthetic organisms capture this energy by converting CO2 to sugars
- Stored as *potential energy* in chemical bonds between atoms in the sugar molecules
1.3 * 10^24 Calories/Year

# What is energy?
- energy is the capacity to do work (or cause change or supply heat)
- exists in 2 states:
	1. Kinetic - energy of motion
	2. Potential - stored energy
- Many forms - mechanical, heat, sound, electric current, light, or radioactivity
- Heat the most convenient way of measuring energy
	- 1 calorie = heat required to raise 1g of water 1$\degree$C
	- 1 kcal = 1000 calories
	- calorie or Calorie?

kid on a slide example

# Kinetic Energy (or Thermal Energy)
- is energy of movement, measured as *temperature*
- if an object has a *low temperature*:
	- its molecules are moving slowly
	- we perceive this as "cold"
- vice versa

Q. Which has potential energy?
	A. Starch, Fat, & ATP

# Laws of Thermodynamics
- first law of thermodynamics states that *energy cannot be created or destroyed*
	- energy can only change from one form to another
	- total amount of energy in the universe remains constant
	- during each conversion, some energy is lost as heat
	- energy available in the universe to do work *decreases* as more of it is progressively lost as heat

-Second law of thermodynamics st...
