What is Science?
- you are a living organism, the class is about you
- "this class makes CS majors a better person"
-  bio is interconnected with all the other natural sciences, esp chem and physics
- 1st topic is basically intro chem
- science is a way of asking questions to understand the world
- bio is a DENSE field, we only skim ~ the first 20% of the textbook

Supplemental Instruction (SI)
	peer-to peer study assistance
		SI is Arlie, their 3rd sem
		optional, but they do kahoots and other study things before exams, etc

Outline - Class 1
Biology is the Science of Life
* bio unifies much of natural science
* life defies simple definition
	* living systems are the most complex chemical systems on Earth - fueled by energy from the sun
	* All life is constrained by the properties of chemistry and physics
* Science is becoming more interdisciplinary
	* combining multiple fields to solve biological problems

Defining Life
What makes Something "Alive"?
7 criteria
1. Cellular organization
	* not viruses lmao
2. Ordered Complexity
3. Sensitivity
	* responding to the environment
	* sunflowers following the sun, people sweating
4.  Growth, development, and reproduction
5. energy utilization
6. homeostasis
	* ability to keep a consistent internal environment
7. evolutionary adaptation
	* on the species level, not the individual level

hierarchical organization, we focus on certain levels
(atoms to whole organism)
