test M does NOT cover ch 7, just ch 5 and 6
	note that 7 is "extremely extremely important, and also the hardest thing we've done yet"

# Exergonic reactions:
- release energy
- spontaneous
- $\Delta$G < 0 (negative)
	![[Pasted image 20241009090757.png]]

# Endergonic Reactions
- require energy
- $\Delta$G > 0 (positive)

#MEMORIZE *be able to identify which is which based on a graph, etc.*

# Enzymes: Biological Catalysts
- Most enzymes are globular proteins
	- some are RNA
- shape of enzyme stabilizes a temporart association between substrates
- Enzyme not changed or consumed in reaction - can be used over and over again
- EX: Carbonic anhydrase
	- 200 molecules /hr made without enzyme
	- 600,000 molecules /sec with enzyme

#MEMORIZE the term *Active Site*
#MEMORIZE the term *Induced Fit*

![[Pasted image 20241009091557.png]]

reminders:
- enzymes typically end in *-ase*\
	- ex: sucr*ase* is an enzyme that breaks down sucrose (the disaccharide, table sugar)

# Enzyme Function
- rate of enzyme-catalyzed reaction depends on concentrations of substrates and enzyme
- any chemical or physical condition that affects the enzyme's 3D shape can change rate
	- optimum temperature
	- optimum pH
	- Binding of regulatory molecules

If an enzyme has a trmperature optimum of 37C why does it have lower activity at 50C?
	at too high temperatures, the enzyme denatures. Even a little bit of denaturation is enough to prevent induced fit, preventing reactions in the first place

If an enzyme has a trmperature optimum of 37C why does it have lower activity at 10C?
	at too low of a temperature, the substrates don't have enough kinetic energy to reach the enzyme fast enough

why does changing pH change enzyme activity?

If an enzyme has a pH optimum of 7, why does it have lower activity at pH 3 or 10? What types of bonds are disrupted?
	we disrupt hydrogen and ionic bonds, and thus tertiary structure

# Two Types of Inhibitors
- inhibitor - substance that binds to enzyme and decreases its activity
- *Competitive* inhibitor
	- competes with substrate for active site
- *Noncompetitive* inhibitor
	- binds to enzyme at a site other than active site
	- causes shape change that makes enzyme unable to bind to substrate

# Allosteric Enzymes

Allo: other
Steric: relating to an atom's position in the molecule

- Allosteric enzymes - enzymes exist in active and inactive forms
- Most noncompetitive inhibitors bind to allosteric site - chemical on/off switch
- Allosteric inhibitor - binds to allosteric site and reduces enzyme activity
- Allosteric activator - binds to allosteric site and increases enzyme activity

# More Enzyme Regulation
- Cofactors
	- Metal ions often found in active site of enzyme and participate in reaction
	- required in diet in trace amount
- Coenzyme
	- non-protein organic cofactors
	- Examples: vitamins, modified nucleotides
	- Important in redox reactions (NAD+)

# But what about endergonic reactions???
- How can they occur if they all require energy?

# ATP
- Adenosine triphosphate (a nucleotide)
- Main energy "currency" all cells use
- Composed of:
	- Ribose - 5 carbon sugar
	- Adenine - *(2 C-N rings = purine)*
	- Chain of 3 phosphates
		- key to energy storage
		- bonds are unstable - highly negatively charged phosphate groups repel each other
		- ADP - 2 phosphates
		- AMP - 1 phosphate - lowest energy form

ATP is made in the mitochondria thru cellular respiration

# ATP cycle
- ATP hydrolysis drives *endergonic* reactions
	- unstable bonds have low activation energy and are easily broken
	- when broken, can transfer a considerable amount of energy
	- 7.3 kcal/mol is released
	- Coupled reaction results in net release of energy
		- (-$\Delta$G = endergonic and spontaneous)

- ATP not suitable for long-term energy storage
	- High energy bonds in ATP are unstable
	- Fats and carbohydrates better
	- Cells store only a few seconds worth of ATP; continually are making more from ADP + Pi 
- Estimated that even a sedentary individual turns over an amount of ATP in one day roughly equal to his or her body weight!

# Metabolism
- total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism
- *Anabolic* reactions/anabolism
	- expend energy to builld up molecules
- *Catabolic* reactions/catabolism
	- harvest energy by breaking down molecules
