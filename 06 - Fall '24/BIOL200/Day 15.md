plasma membrane
nucleus/nucleoid


-----------
# Endoplasmic reticulum
- Rough endoplasmic reticulum (REM)
	- attachment of ribosomes to the membrane gives a rough appearance
	- synthesis of proteins to be secreted, sent to lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membrane
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)
	- relatively few bound ribosomes
	- many enzymes embedded in membranes
	- variety of functions - carb and lipid synthesis, store intracellular Ca(2+), detoxification of foreign substances
- Ratio of RER to SER depends on cell's function
	- cells that carry out extesnisve lipid synthesis (brain, testes, intestine) have more SER
	- Cells that synthesize proteins that are more secreted (like anti-bodies) have more RER

how do different types of cells in the same multicellular organism get their functions? (ie neuron cell vs kidney cell)
	you start out as one cell that divides a lot
	the divided cells all have the same genetic material of that first cell
	answer later

note that there is an "inside" and an "outside" to the Endoplasmic Reticulum
	the inside is called the *lumen* #MEMORIZE 

# Golgi Apparatus
- flattened stacks of interconnected membranes (Golgi bodies)
- Functions in packaging and distribution of molecules synthesized at one location and used at another within the cell or even outside of it
- Has *cis* (front or receiving end) and *trans* faces
- Vesicles transport molecules to destination
- Proteins and lipids synthesized in ER are transported into Golgi and commonly modified by addition of short sugar chains
- Enzymes in Golgi can also clelave or modify sugars already added to proteins and lipids in ER
- another function is synthesis of cell-wall components and synthesis of secreted polysaccharides (plants)

Vesicle: "a small, mini membrane-bound compartment"

# Lysosomes
- membrane-bounded digestive vesicles
- Arise from Golgi apparatus
- Hydrolytic enzymes catalyze breakdown of all 4 types of macromolecules (proteins, carbs, lipids, nucleic acids)
- Breakdown old organelles and recycle components
- Destroy cells or foreign matter that the cell has engulfed by phagocytosis
- Enzymes optimally active at acid pH; proton pumps activated by fusion food vesicle or old organelle, causing pH inside lysosome to drop

# Microbodies
- variety of enzyme-bearing, membrane-enclosed vesicles
- primary way cells organize their metabolism
- *Peroxisomes*
	- contain enzymes involved in th e oxidation of fatty acids
	- hydrogen peroxide produced as by-product - rendered harmless by catalase

# Vacuoles
- membrane-bounded structures in plants
- various functions depending on the cell type
	- water balance
	- storage of useful molecules as well as waste products
- There are different types of vacuoles:
	- central vacuole in plant cells
	- contractile vacuole of some fungi and protists
	- storage vacuoles

- *Tonoplast* = membrane surrounding vacuole
- Vacuole maintains tonicity of plant cells, allowing cells to expand or contract depending on conditions
- Plant cells grow by expanding the vacuole

# Mitochondria
- found in all types of eukaryotic cells
- bound by 2 membranes
	- outer membrance
	- intermembrane space
	- inner membrane has cristae (layers of folded membrane)
	- matrix
- On the surface of the inner membrane, and also embedded within it, are proteins that carry out oxidative metabolism; folds increase the surface area available for these enzymes
- Mitochondria contain their own DNA but are not fully autonomous; still require proteins encoded by genes in the nucleus
- Mitochondria can divide, doubling their number; they can be segregated between 2 new cells
- Mitochondria are *maternally* inherited

# Chloroplasts
- organelles present in cells of plants and some other eukaryotes
- contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis
- surrounded by 2 membranes
- thylakoids are membranous sacs within the inner membrane
	- Grana are stacks of thylakoids
	- photosynthetic pigments are on surface of thylakoids
- Have their own DNA

# Endosymbiosis
- proposes that some of today's eukaryotic organelles evolved by a symbiosis arising between 2 cells that were each free-living
- one cell, a prokaryote, was engulfed by and became part of another cell, which was the precursor of modern eukaryotes
- engulfed prokaryotes gave hosts some metabolic advantages
- mitochondria and chloroplasts

# Cytoskeleton
- network of protein fibers found in all eukaryotic cells
	- supports the shape of the cell
	- keeps organelles in fixed locations
- *Dynamic* system - constantly forming and disassembling
- Fibers are polymers of identical protein monomers that attract one another and spontaneously form into long chains

# 3 types of fibers
- Microfilaments (actin filaments)
	- two protein chains loosely twined together
	- movements like contraction, crawling, "pinching"
	- smallest of the 3
- Microtubules
	- largest of the cytoskeletal elements
	- Dimers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-tubulin subunits
	- facilitate movement of cell and materials within cell
	- segregate chromosomes during mitosis
	- largest of the 3
	- "interstate highway inside the cell"
- Intermediate filaments
	- between the size of actin filaments and microtubules
	- very stable - usually not broken down
