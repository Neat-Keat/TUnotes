40 points of other short answer questions
 
Chapter seven – formation of planetary systems
   

Hubble Ultra Deep Field  
"Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe, they form groups, and then groups of groups"
 
Newton's Infinite Universe  
"Space is infinite because if a clump of stars had an edge, then everything would collapse bc gravity"  
Wrong, this happens, just on smaller scales
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Molecular Clouds start out cold, rotating slowly, and much larger than they end (50,000 AU?)  
They flatten because of centripetal force  
[INSERT PICTURE OF WHITEBOARD]
   

They get hotter because of energy  
Forms of energy:  
Kinetic energy – energy of motion  
Potential Energy – stored energy of position  
Thermal Energy – kinetic energy on a molecular scale
 
PE -> KE -> TE
 
They spin faster because of the Conservation of Angular Momentum  
Angular momentum depends on the mass distribution of an object and the rate of spin of an object  
As one changes, the other has to change to compensate  
Think figure skaters spinning arms out vs arms in  
Clouds begin to spin bc there are too many particles to have everything cancel out > a motion is generated > leads to rotation
   

Stars are defined by their NUCLEAR REACTIONS

ACCRETION  
In a molecular cloud: particles stick to each other, gradually forming chunks, chunks form planetesimals, planetesimals form protoplanets, protoplanets form terrestrial planets
 
Temperature Profile of Early Solar Nebula
 ![Temperature of the Solar Nebula Earth 2000 Jupiter Saturn Uranus Metals Silicates, 1000 rocky material Water ice Ammonia ice O 10 15 20 5 Distance from Sun (ALI.)' Inside the orbit of the Earth, only metals can condense out of the solar nebula. Rocky (silicates) can condense near Mars. In the outer solar system, water and ammonia ice can survive. ](Exported%20image%2020240525203908-0.png) ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203908-1.png)

The further out material is, the colder it is
 
Refractory Materials are those which condense at a high temp, closer to sun  
Volatile Materials are those which condense at a low temp, further from sun
 
More material available further away from sun, so planets further away tend to be bigger
