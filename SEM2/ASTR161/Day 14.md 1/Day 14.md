Green Flash  
Dispersion is wavelength dependent  
Refraction thru a prism  
Right before the sun goes down, the last light seen is green  
Any shorter wavelength is scattered in the atmosphere

8:100 decaying to 3:100  
1 half life = 4:100  
2 half lives = 2:100  
1.5 half lives ~= 3:100

Density = mass/volume  
Volume can be measured, mass comes from Kepler's 3rd law (specifically newton's version) ((4pi^2)/(GM))a^3 = T^2 (it has mass!!)
 
Total Density of Earth = 5480 kg/m^3  
Total Density of surface material = 3000 kg/m^3  
Implies that the core is denser than the crust

Seismic waves
 ![p- and S-waves 00999 90f/e 00 +0 taxies ](Exported%20image%2020240525203916-2.png)

Transverse waves can't go through liquids or solids
 
L waves go along the surface  
(they don’t penetrate into the earth)  
P waves are longitudinal  
(short for primary, can go through the core, but refract)  
S waves are transverse  
(short for secondary, CANT go through the core)
   

Seismometers around the earth allow us to reverse engineer waves and construct images of the interior of the earth
 
2) Heating and Cooling
 
All planets were hot when first formed  
Believed to be formed thru collisions, radioactivity was much higher
 
Cooling is a matter of Geometry  
Heat escapes a planet through its surface (I.e. area)  
Amount of Interior heat depends on volume  
A = r^2  
V = r^3  
Implies volume grows faster than area, so larger planets cool lower
 
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Radius|Surface|Volume|surface/volume|
|1|1|1|1/1|
|10|100|1,000|1/10|
|100|10,000|1,000,000|1/100|
 
On the biological level, smaller animals cool off more rapidly than larger animals  
Which is why small animals like mice need to eat constantly  
And why mice getting wet on a warm day can still freeze!
 
3) Magnetism
 ![The Earth's Magnetic Field North Magnetic Polé • South Geographic Magnetic South Pole Pole Geographic North Pole Peter Reid ](Exported%20image%2020240525203916-4.png)   
Magnetic fields are created by aligning all the atoms in a material the same way  
This can be done by wrapping conductive materials in a current carrying wire to make an electromagnet!
 
**You need a conducting material and a rotational motion for a magnetic field**
 
Because the earth has a liquid core with iron and it spins, it behaves like a magnet  
Not exactly, there's an alignment problem between rotation axis and magnetic axis  
Geographic north and magnetic north are off by ~ 11.5 degrees  
This fucks up maps lol
 
Uranus is off by 59 degrees  
Neptune is off by 47 degrees  
Saturn is off by 0 degrees!  
Jupiter is off by 10 degrees
 
The Earth undergoes magnetic reversals every 200,000-300,000 years  
We arent quite sure why lol  
Mars does too!  
So does the Sun every 11 years!

The Aurora Borealis is caused by some solar winds sneaking through earth's atmosphere!
 
The moon has almost no magnetic field  
Bc its core is tiny and it doesn’t rotate v fast
 
Venus also doesn’t really have a magnetic field bc it takes too long to rotate
 
4) Tectonism

Continental Drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1915  
Discredited bc "where does the energy come from?"
 
Energy comes from convection currents!
