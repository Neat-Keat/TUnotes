Below the photosphere the sun is too thick to radiate  
Above the photosphere the sun is too thin to radiate  
In the 500km thick photosphere
 
LAYERS
 
CORE---PHOTOSPHERE = 700,000km  
Radiation zone close to the core where temps are highest  
Convection Zone past this to the photosphere  
Photosphere and beyond is too thin to convect, so it radiates  
The top of the inside has a strong magnetic field, which is what causes the giant spicules that can extend into the chromosphere  
PHOTOSPHERE--- CHROMOSPHERE = 500km  
5800K at bottom of photosphere  
4400K at top of photosphere (coolest spot on the sun!)  
We know this from limb darkening!

B is cooler than A, even though they're the same distance L from the "surface"
 
Because the photosphere is cooler, it absorbs Hydrogen radiation  
Because the Chromosphere is hot, it emits Hydrogen radiation  
CHROMOSPHERE---CORONA  
What you see is mostly the chromosphere  
The corona is extremely high temperature  
~2,000,000K  
But theres so few particles that the total energy isnt that great  
This causes particles to be ejected at high speeds, creating solar winds  
Corona has Fe(+++), etc, which shows how ionized the corona is (and how hot it is!)
   

SUN SPOTS!  
Caused by magnetic field?  
The Suns magnetic field is not much bigger than the Earth's  
But it gets concentrated in certain sports, which is where sun spots come from

We think the field is mostly in the convection zone  
The field folds over onto itself because the equator rotates faster than the poles

Coronal loops show the magnetic field taking charged particles into the corona and back in!
 
But why are they cooler?  
The magnetic field prevents hot gas from rising, lowering the temp of the surface above it!

How much cooler?
 
The photosphere is 5800K  
The Penumbra is cooler  
The Umbra is 4300K
 
Flux = Energy emitted per sec per unit area = CT^4  
Flux(photosphere)/Flux(umbra) = 5800^4 / 4300^4 ~= 3.3  
3.3 times as much energy in the photosphere vs the umbra
 
The sun has a weird sun spot cycle that lasts 11 years

For whatever reason, from 1643-1715 there were no recorded sun spots  
This is called the maunder minimum

When 2 flares collide, they reduce energy by emitting a solar flare
 
Filaments are lines between sunspot groups  
Prominences are basically the same thing  
The difference is what angle you view them at??
 
Coronal Holes  
Usually, the magnetic fields forming a coronal loop falls back to the photosphere (A). But sometimes the fields do not fall back (B). This creates a Coronal Hole. The coronal plasma rushes outward, adding greatly to the solar wind

Carrington Event 1859  
Huge solar flare w/ catastrophic events  
When the solar wind hit us, there were a LOT more charged particles in the atmosphere  
The only electrical system at the time was the telegraph system  
Operators were burned bad, and the system was out for a long time
 
Oscillation in the sun  
Remember that the sun is evolving along the HR diagram  
This means it's never quite stable  
This makes some spots vibrate in and some vibrate out  
The sun oscillates
