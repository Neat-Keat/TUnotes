Cambrian Explosion:  
Triggered by rising oxygen levels  
Great increase in # of species  
Diversification – movement to land
 
Hydrothermal Vents and Tidal pools  
Used to be much more violent, can be used as a source of energy and mixes chemicals
 
95% of all living matter is composed of 4 elements

- Hydrogen
- Oxygen
- Carbon
- Nitrogen
 
How do you make something as versatile as life tho?  
Noble gases!

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Element|# of electrons to be stable|
|Helium|2|
|Neon|10|
|Argon|18|
|Krypton|36|
 
These don’t really combine with anything, so they're p stable
 
Ionic Bonding  
NaCl (table salt)  
Na(11) + Cl(17) transfers 1 electron  
Na(10)+Cl(18)  
Na(+)Cl(-)
 
But this is too stable, hard to break apart and form other structures
 
Covalent Bonding  
Methane  
CH(4)

Now all hydrogen have 2 electrons AND Carbon has 10!  
These are both stable thru essentially sharing electrons
 
This is much more flexible and impermanent than ionic bonding  
Most organic tissue is covalently bonded

Only Carbon can triple bond btw lol

This shows the importance of Carbon in living tissue
 
Why not silicon?  
Silicon *does* bond to itself, but this is p weak  
Silicon *does* bond to oxygen, but this forms a gel/liquid  
Silicon *does* bond to 2 oxygen (silicon dioxide), but this is basically quartz
 
Glycine: the simplest amino acid

So how hard is it to make glycine?
 
UREY-MILLER EXPERIMENT  
They emulated pre-biotic life, then used "lighting" on the mixture and created amino acids (11/20 typical of life)  
They used H2, H20, CH4, and NH3 to simulate the primitive atmosphere
 
All life on Earth has Left-Handed amino acids, while space stuff is right handed
 
Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring ~ 100C  
Antarctica is very cold
 
Lake Vida  
19 meters under the crust of Antarctica  
Bacteria was frozen in the ice  
After being warmed up, they came back to life!
 
Lake Vostok  
4km below Antarctic sheet  
The ice at the bottom of the sheet is around 420,000 years old

Tardigrade

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203945-5.png)  

An organism able to go decades without food or water, survive temps from near absolute 0 to well above 100C, pressures from near 0 to greater than the ocean floors, survive direct exposure to dangerous radiations  
They can repair their own DNA
