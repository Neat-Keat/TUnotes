Uranus was found by accident by a comet hunter  
Neptune was found bc Uranus's orbit wasn't perfectly newtonian, implying another object pulling on it
 
Noble Gasses don’t bond with anything else
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Jupiter and Saturn have thick atmospheres  
They have horizontal bands bc of their rotation
 
Jupiter's Great Red Spot!  
It’s a cyclone  
First observed in 1654, there ever since
 
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9  
Comet that flew near Jupiter  
Jupiter's Gravity broke it up  
After waiting for it to come back to Jupiter on the 2nd pass, we knew it'd crash  
Spectrum analysis time baybee!
 
Galileo's Atmosphere Probe
 
The Cassini Space probe orbited Saturn for 13 years, got high-res images of Saturn  
Sent its last image before plunging into Saturn in 2017
 
The Noble Gas Problem  
The noble gases in Jupiter were 3x more abundant than in the sun  
Where'd they come from?  
Not comets, jupiter's too warm for those ices  
What about planet migration?  
Perhaps Jupiter spent some time farther from the Sun  
Colder – ices of noble gases could exist
 
Compare to exoplanets  
Many jupiter sized planets in mercury sized orbits  
Called "Hot Jupiters"  
DOES NOT MEAN THAT MOST EXOPLANETS ARE HOT JUPITERS  
This is called the "Selection Effect"  
They're the easiest to observe, so they're observed!
 
The planet migration theory is also called the Nice Theory  
Not conclusive, but interesting idea
 
Late Heavy Bombardment  
Period ~3.1 billion years ago – heavy cratering on moon  
Caused by planet migration?
 
As jupiter orbits deep space, it collides with icy particles (the noble gases?)  
It picks up extra mass AND slows down  
Energy decreases, so its orbit shrinks closer to the sun
 
The further from the sun you are, the total energy needed to be an orbiting particle increases
 
Atmospheric Circulation Patterns on Earth

Warm air heats the equator, pushing it to the poles  
Cold air rushes in the fill the gap
 
Because of the Coriolis Effect, wind is deflected to the RIGHT in the Northern Hemisphere  
Wind is deflected to the LEFT in the Southern Hemisphere
 
Because of the earth's rotation, we don’t have 2 hadley cells, we have 6!
 ![wind and ocean currents The wind drives the flow of the ocean surface currents. Wind and ocean currents flow in the same direction ](Exported%20image%2020240525203920-2.png)  

Trade winds take European trade ships to SA/LATAM  
Westerlies take NA back to EU

||Rotational Period|Equatorial Rotational Velocity|
|Earth|24 hours|.46km/s = 1026 mph|
|Jupiter|9.84 hrs|12.67 km/s = 28,035 mph|
|Saturn|10.69 hrs|10.69 km/s = 23,627 mph|
 
What does this mean?  
REALLY STRONG CORIOLIS EFFECT

THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THEM TO APPEAR TO HAVE HORIZONTAL BANDS!!!!!
 
For some reason, the North Pole of Saturn has a hexagonal structure

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203920-5.png)     

What about neptune and uranus?
 
Neptune has a great dark spot, white clouds, and storms, captured by Voyager 2
 
Neptune also has a slight "banded" structure
      

Consider jupiter experiencing incoming radiation from the sun  
Jupiter radiates off energy, maintaining an equilibrium  
This expected temperature is 109K in the cloud layer  
Somehow, its actually 124K from a probe measurement
 
This tells us abt the flux of the radiation coming from Jupiter  
Flux = radiation energy emitted from each square meter per second  
Constant(Temperature)^4 Stefan-Boltzmann Law
 
Actual Flux/ Expected Flux = T(actual)^4 / T(expected)^4 = (124^4) / (109^4) = 1.67 times as much radiation coming from Jupiter than we'd expect  
This means that Jupiter is actually still contracting / accreting and giving off energy
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Jupiter|1.67|
|Saturn|1.8|
|Uranus|1.0|
|Neptune|2.6|
 
This means that Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune are contracting and giving off energy  
Uranus, however, is probably not contracting  
We don't know why it's different lulw

Oblateness= how out of round something is
 
Differential Rotation  
The poles rotate faster than the equator
 
Magnetic Fields of Jupiter and Saturn  
They have liquid metallic hydrogen in the core  
This is what we expect causes their magnetic fields
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203920-6.png)   
We think Uranus and Neptune's magnetic field is caused by liquid ammonia and water in the core
 
Synchrotron Radiation
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203920-7.png) ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240525203920-8.png)  

Jupiter has synchrotron radiation, implying the strength of its magnetic field
