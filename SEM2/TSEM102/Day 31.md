Aggressive  
Wear suit or uniform, masculine, eliminates them from male gaze (covering clothing)  
Sometimes targets of aggression, especially from other women  
Not flattering clothing, hides their shape  
Walk with masculine, ungraceful gait  
Masculine mannerisms, smoking, flirting with women, carrying weapon  
Protective of their love interests- obsessive and aggressive, entitlement out of intimacy  
Because she almost always loses her love interest to a man, underlying anxiety, contributes to her protectiveness and obsession  
Threatening to men because they flirt with the men's love interests – they might steal the man's woman!  
By end they are contained, threat is eliminated: put down, lost love, become straight  
They threaten by challenging gender roles: call attention to the constructed nature of gender in our culture – if women can do masculine things then are there real differences between men and women?

Very quiet  
Servant ignores her emotions
