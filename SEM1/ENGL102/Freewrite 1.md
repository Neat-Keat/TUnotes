When you think about writing a formal college paper, how does it make you feel? (with emotions)
   

Thinking about writing a "formal college paper" is really intimidating to me. I've never been confident in my writing, and to write something with as much prestige and importance as a "formal college paper" is a bit scary. In high school, the most advanced English class I took was honors Eng. 12, which was awful and built for the lowest common denominator, having a class of 18 year-olds do vocab exercises every 2 weeks. Lately, I've grown a little more confident in my writing, and feel that I might have what it takes to conquer a style as mountainous as "formal college writing", or at the very least slip by unnoticed. I believe I can make connections insightful enough to be worth writing about, but my issue is that I don't think I can write about it in a way that's interesting or relatable or even useful. In addition, all the hyper specific requirements of things like citations and formatting is a lot to comprehend, and I usually end up getting lost without Citation Machine or documents that outline specifically how to format every single time I write. I think in time, however, I'll grow more accustomed to the challenge and even find comfort in the consistency of "formal college papers". Donâ€™t even get me started on accidental plagiarism by the way.
