GENDER  
Studying Both Women's and Men's Experiences in Sport  
Gender is:  
Social Construct  
Ideology  
Dominant gender ideology in the US is based on a binary...  
Leads to a certain type of construction of the categories  
Defines each category as "opposites"  
Doesn't leave space for those who don’t fit into those categories  
Involves inequities in accessing power  
Patriarchy  
Gender, Sport, & Assumptions about sexual orientation  
The impact on both men and women  
Athlete v non-athlete  
Male athletes are assumed to be hetero, female athletes are assumed to be not  
Variability by sport  
Traditionally played by men or women  
Expected behavior: feminine vs. Masculine
 
The Apologetic Response  
A layered piece by the athlete to try to revert to expected gendered behavior  
Female Elite track stars/ tennis/ softball players will put a ribbon in their hair to put a layer of femininity in a masculine sport  
Female bodybuilders focus to develop a "masculine" body  
Quite literally judged on appearance lol  
Leads to apologetic behavior  
Layering with feminine qualities to appeal to judges or out of fear of "not being feminine enough"  
-nail polish, hair up, bikini, makeup, etc.

Ideology – **beliefs** about the way things ought to be that justify current **social arrangements**
