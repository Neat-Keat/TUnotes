CABLINASIAN: portmanteau of CAucasian, BLack, INdian, and ASIAN
 
Intersectionality
 
Minority Group -> Lacks power in comparison to dominant group  
Suffers disadvantages due to systemic discrimination
 
Sport participation among African Americans  
The Facts Show:

- Prior to the 1950's sport in the US was racially segregated
- African Americans generally participate in a very limited range of sports
- African Americans are clearly underrepresented in most sports
 
False assumption that black and whites in sport have an equitable experience  
Only 1 or 2 black tennis players have tennis coverage other than that very little representation  
Generalizes to the majority of our sports
 
Tiger Woods disrupts dominant racial ideology  
Couldn’t play in certain clubs in the 90s because he was black  
Got death threats for being a black athlete in a white sport  
You need to be part of the dominant group to produce change, so expecting TW to change everything is unrealistic  
Identifies as Cablinasian
 
Sport Participation Among Latinx Athletes
 
Latino American athletes will likely receive more academic attention by sport sociologists

- One of the fastest growing ethnic populations
- Approx. 30% of MLB players
- Soccer has an overrepresentation as well
 
Past Studies – Lumped this population in with African Americans or an "other" category.  
Obv bad because it disregards their perspective
 
Soccer is played by poorer, working class folk in other countries  
Soccer is played in upper middle class, white suburban communities in the US  
Latinx individuals change that
 
SPORT PARTICIPATION AMONG ASIAN AMERICANS
 
Initially very few studies; therefore, little was known about Asian American athletes' experiences. But recently some research has focused on Asian athletes  
E.g. their mediated representation.
 
There is a need to analyze this population in segments
 
Sport participation patterns of Asian Americans vary with their immigration histories.
 
Female Asian Americans in Golf are sexualized, men are the opposite
 
SPORT PARTICIPATION AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS
 
Native Americans comprise dozens of diverse cultural groups  
Traditional Native American sports combine physical activities with ritual and ceremony  
Native Americans often fear losing their culture when playing Euro-American sports  
Not from all, but from some. They represent a culture that tried genociding them  
Widely accepted Racial and ethnic stereotypes have restricted their access to sport participation
 
Where is the honor in the Cleveland Indians (or other racist logos)?
