Ideology – beliefs about what ought to be that justify current social arrangements
 
The Female Athlete  
The Impact of Traditional Gender Ideology  
Beliefs about women  
Social Arrangements – Paternalism
 
Traditional role of women:  
Wife/mother first (Victorian era/ 19th century vibes)  
Characterizes women as weak + Dependent  
Traditional expectations of femininity
 
PATERNALISM  
Assuming you should make a choice for someone else  
"you're too immature to make that decision for yourself"  
Can be men and women contributing to Paternalistic approach  
Women weren't supposed to use a baby carriage because they shouldn't leave the house  
Gives them independence *gasp*  
"women shouldn't transport, they'll be infertile!"  
"Women can't run marathons, we'll rip of their numbers!"  
"they aren't capable"
 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  
2 max in each section  
No running in different thirds  
Prevents players from becoming stars because they can't solo carry  
Later changed from thirds to halves with the same rules
 
SOCIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRESS TOWARD EQUITY

1. Women's Movement
2. Title IX
3. Health/ Fitness Movement
4. Media 
Attempt in the 60s/70s to expand the roles of women  
Secretaries, teachers, politics > whatever they want  
Specifically about education in 1972  
There just happened to be school sports lol  
Led to increased opportunities for female athletes to play w/ school money  
Everything before was intramural or hidden lol  
80-90% are NOT in compliance TODAY (see below)  
Kennedy wanted Americans to be active, so they became active  
Sport equipment manufacturers start making for women (only for money lol)  
Women are more open about their participation  
LPGA, Women's tennis, etc. Covers women's sport  
Also a bad thing (see below)
 
SOCIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF INEQUITY/ REGRESSION

1. Backlash
2. Title IX – Women lost coaching & admin positions
3. Cosmetic FItness
4. Media 
Negative response to social change  
Often uninformed or misinformed  
Women were insulted, called slurs (Amazons, Dykes) to make women uncomfortable and revert to how stuff was before  
Women hid their athleticism to avoid the backlash  
Before 1972, we had women's athletic directors run by women athletic directors  
After, lots of programs were merged and women athletic directors lost their jobs  
100% women coaching women to 40% today (97% for men skull)  
Women coach less then ¼ of all sports teams  
Producing an aesthetic/ look without actually being fit  
Anabolic steroids, plastic surgery, fad dieting  
WNBA, ABL is covered in a certain way  
Female athletes are covered in more negative packaging by commentators  
Accomplishments played down  
Compared to males, not the other way around  
Uses first names  
Camera looks down upon them and objectifies female athletes
 
Women are designated to a third, cant cross lines

Need to know there was a big drop, not necessarily the exact numbers

Dancers eat cotton to feel full without actually eating :skull:

ABL's tagline: "Real Basketball"
 
WNBA  
"watch us because our athletes are hot lol"
