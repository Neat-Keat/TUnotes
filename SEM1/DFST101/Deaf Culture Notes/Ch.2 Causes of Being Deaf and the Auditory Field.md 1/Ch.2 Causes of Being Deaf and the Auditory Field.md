People who don't hear or speak the same can either identify as:  
Deaf  
deaf  
Deaf-Blind  
DeafDisabled  
Hard of hearing  
Late-deafened  
**ASK HOW THEY WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED  
Use DDBDDHHLD when talking about all groups together

No proof that learning sign takes away from learning spoken lang  
Not learning sign is bad for deaf children  
Learning speech through sign has benefits

Audiogram measures sound from 0-120 dB and 125-8000 hz

Presbycusis:  
Changes in hearing levels, particularly high frequency, through age

"'hearing' is not an exact science, and everyone varies in their processing of sound."

Designated by an ASL sign, DEAF (with puffed cheeks), which is loosely translated as “truly Deaf” or “so Deaf.”

Deaf people see countless Audiologists, and have many Audiograms  
Audiograms can be used for:  
Qualifying for the Deaflympics  
Receiving Vocational Rehabilitation and Social Security benefits  
Eligibility for admission at educational institutions/ program serving deaf students.  
Audiologists use "Hearing Impaired", even though the community doesn't like it  
Deaf from birth/ age  
Prelingually deaf = deaf before hearing/ speaking/ signing  
Postlingually deaf = deaf after hearing/ speaking/ signing
 
deaf before/at birth (congenital) and after birth (acquired).
 
Hard of Hearing: slight to moderate hearing loss  
May benefit from amplification devices, may not  
Can identify as Deaf, even if they can hear
 
VERY-HARD-OF-HEARING (puffed cheeks)  
Means someone is "almost hearing"  
LITTLE-HARD-OF-HEARING  
Means someone is "mostly deaf"
 
Issues in the outer and middle ear are called conductive. Issues happening inside the ear or within the auditory nerve are called sensorineural
 
GENETIC CAUSES  
In deaf babies, 50% are deaf because of genes, whether inherited or mutated  
400 identifiable genes related to deafness  
2/3 are nonsyndromic (only deaf, nothing else)  
1/3 are syndromic (deaf + blindness, heart conditions, etc.)  
Examples of deaf (and additional disabilities) include people having Huntersyndrome (growth failure), Usher syndrome (progressive blindness), and Waardenburg syndrome (pigment abnormalities)
 
ACQUIRED DEAFNESS:  
Deaf due to external factors, not genetics  
Examples include diseases such as meningitis, Ménière disease, premature births, fetal alcohol syndrome, or simply becoming elderly  
Most common cause is damage to the hearing mechanisms  
Caused by prolonged exposure to acute, loud noise, drugs, aging, and diseases
 
CONDUCTIVE:  
Outer/ Middle Ear  
Ears arent fully open, excess earwax, ear infections, and physical injuries  
Usually fixable thru medicine/ surgery  
Surgeries include removing excessive buildup of fluid, adding a tube, removing a blockage, repairing by adding a skin graft, or reconstruction of the damaged parts inside the ear  
Usually temporary
 
SENSORINEURAL￼Limited to the inner ear, specifically the Cochlea and connecting auditory nerve  
Cochlea contains 20,000 hairs that transmit signal to auditory nerve  
Can be messed up if missing hair  
Usually permanent  
Usually experience drastic changes in perceived volume
 
Most historical "cures" for deafness are just abusive and have no basis in cure.  
Smacking someone hard enough to fracture their skull to "shake something loose"  
Pouring hot oil + worms down the ear
 
Up until recently, deaf students were forced to speak and read lips, and were punished for ASL  
"that'd encourage them to integrate with the hearing world"  
False, obviously
 
"For many centuries, there was a prevailing belief that people who were disabled at birth were being punished or were manifesting demonic origins, this being predetermined by the gods."

Hearing aids through time:  
￼Ear trumpets: makes the outer ear "dish" even bigger  
1st Wearable Hearing Aid: 1936  
Worn on the body by 1950's  
1960's-80's, schoolchildren were forced to use body hearing aids  
Violently loud  
Cochlear Implant Surgery: FDA approved in 1984 for adults, 1990 for 2 Y/Os, and 12 M/O in 2002  
Can cause frequent severe and debilitating headaches and vertigo, in addition to large, visible scars from the surgery  
Most recipients don’t understand WHY they're having surgery, but were forced anyways  
Caused tension/ distrust between the Deaf and the medical community/ auditory innovations  
Deaf babies respond to every stimuli EXCEPT sound, which can make testing for deafness difficult  
Before **early infant hearing screening laws in 1990**, children were often identified as deaf around age 2.5/3  
Tested with AABR (automated auditory brainstem response)  
Measures signals up the brainstem  
Failure > retest > full battery of hearing tests > otolaryngologist > audiologist

EXPOSE DEAF INFANTS TO SIGN LANGUAGE  
Exposure to sign > deprived from all lang  
Isolation can lead to academic, social, and cognitive delay later
   

Deaf community thinks that audiologists and the medical field are corroborating by forcing cochlear implants, which are expensive  
Because most audiologists follow AG Bell's philosophies on "medicine first, ASL second"

Some professionals recommend Listening + Spoken Language (LSL) programs  
Still deprives infants of Sign, and Deaf Culture  
Can be contractually enforced
 
Modern approach is multilingual and multimodal  
Includes reading, writing, and speaking in both English and ASL

Hearing aids can be:  
Behind the ear  
In the ear  
In the canal  
Completely in the canal  
In the middle ear  
In the frames of eyeglasses
 
All amplify and direct sound to the inner ear
 
Digital Hearing aids can tune out nature and focus on speech
 
Effectiveness relies on residual hearing  
The profoundly deaf will crank up amplification, warping sound to be unintelligible  
Some can hear sirens w/ aid  
Some can hear lang in a quiet room  
Some can hear lang in a noisy environment  
Some can hear music  
Some wear only around hearing family  
Can cost $1000-$6000 and usually ARENT covered by insurance

COCHLEAR IMPLANTS:  
The way cochlear implants work is that there is an internal part (coil) that is surgically implanted in the cochlea (inside the inner ear) and directly attached to the auditory nerve. This implant has electrodes that allow external sounds to skip the cochlea that is not working and be converted into electrical impulses that can travel through the auditory nerve, which then sends signals to the brain
 
Cochlear implants do not amplify sound—instead, the sounds are transmitted directly to the auditory nerve. This device is attached to a magnet that is inserted behind the skin on the skull. The skull is slightly drilled in order to make a depression the size and depth of a quarter to fit a magnet on the side of the head. Then the external hearing aid, along with a magnetic field, is attracted to the magnet embedded under the skin behind the ear. This allows the recipient to take off or put on the device easily. Some people receive an implant for one ear, and some receive implants for both ears
 
Does NOT depend on residual hearing  
Recommended for the profoundly deaf because it *can* wipe out any residual hearing  
Happens when the implant damages Cochlear hairs  
Only works if auditory nerve still works
 
Qualifications:  
Deaf  
Working auditory nerve  
Vaccinated against possible infections  
Esp. spinal meningitis  
Financial Means to cover extra, unexpected costs  
Regular access to transportation for follow-ups  
Enrollment in a speaking and listening course
 
Adults who have had recent cochlear implantation and had some hearing before the surgery say that the sounds seem mechanical or computerized after surgery
 
Mapping:  
Adjusting volume to be interpretable
 
Shelf life of 5-10 years, so there will be lots of repairs/replacements to the device
 
In the 1980s through the early 2000s, there were reports of partial facial paralysis, painful tics caused by electrical stimulation, dizziness and vertigo, and even death as a result of obtaining a cochlear implant  
(The deaths were mainly caused by anesthesia before going into surgery or due to postoperative infection, particularly meningitis. Currently, patients are required to get vaccinated for meningitis before undergoing cochlear implant surgery, reducing postoperative infection leading to death)
   

Many common misconceptions involving cochlear implants are that they prevent children from going swimming, going on rollercoasters, or playing sports. Some say cochlear implant users cannot drive hybrid cars, go scuba diving, or walk through Travel Security Agency (TSA) metal detectors at the airport. All  
>just remove the device when showering/ swimming  
>rollercoasters can dislodge the device  
>use helmets playing sports  
>no adverse effects for driving a hybrid car?  
>don’t scuba dive too deep lol  
>carry "Patient Emergency Identification Card" for TSA metal detectors  
>don't go boxing dummy  
>might have to be surgically removed/ reattached when getting an MRI
 
"inability to upgrade the implant, having implant damage (from impact), unavailability of replacement parts, infection requiring removal, long-term effects, implant failure, skin irritation, dependency on batteries, and dependency on audiologists to assist with programming the settings in the device."
 
Cochlear Implant userbase still rising lol

COSTS $100,000 WHAT  
NOT EVEN COVERED BY INSURANCE

INSPIRATION PORN:
 
Feel-good videos of deaf people hearing for the first time, etc.  
Superficial, manipulative, damaging, exploitative, promotes a twisted dynamic  
Victim shames the deaf that can't hear  
"they didn't do enough to be 'successful'".

GENETIC TESTING  
"Most Deaf people are resistant to genetic testing, believing it may do more harm than good"  
Prenatal testing and deciding to not have a baby with an inclination to be deaf, blind, short, etc. INHERITLY means that you think those people are worth less than "normal"  
3% of prenatal testing parents intentionally select eggs prone to disability  
2008 UK legislature forces embryo selection to be on the grounds of preventing disease  
Unfair to the Deaf
 
CRISPR can either cause meaningful discovery, or dangerous pathogens
 
Hearing and deaf people tend to think differently, with hearing people seeing deafness as a medical issue to be prevented or cured, while culturally Deaf people feel that “deaf” is not a medical problem but a proud identity and culture
