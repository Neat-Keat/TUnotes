Critical Race Theory: perspective of society while considering how race, law, and power altogether affect everyone.  
1976: "You cant be discriminated on the basis of BOTH race AND gender at the same time! That’s ludicrous"  
"Intersectionality is an analytic sensibility, a way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power."
 
"There is no “the” Deaf community. There are Deaf communities. The Deaf communities are so vast and diverse that words cannot even describe these communities"
 
Marginalized communities usually get excluded from textbooks, media, leadership

Intersectionality is originally designed by a black woman for black women

"While it is absolutely valid that Deaf people can experience multiple oppressions at once, intersectionality doesn’t always apply to everyone. For example, a white Deaf woman can experience sexism and audism, but intersectionality would not apply to this scenario. This is because the said person’s race is a systematic privilege itself. People who are white could experience two or more systematic oppressions at once. However, because of the societal implications, their race plays a significant role in the power dynamics. That being said, the coauthors want to recognize the origin and the drive behind intersectionality."
