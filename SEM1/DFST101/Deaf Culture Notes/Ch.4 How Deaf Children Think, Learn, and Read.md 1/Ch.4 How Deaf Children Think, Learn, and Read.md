Culture and Language  
Cultural role modeling plays a pivotal role in forming how students develop thinking and learning skills.  
Socially Mediated Learning (Vygotsky, 1980): children best learn how to think thru interactions with those more experienced  
This is a problem for Deaf people, because Deaf role models are underrepresented  
Some Deaf children experience language delay, impacting performance on English based IQ tests  
Can lead to misdiagnoses of intellectual disability, autism, etc.  
Lack of access to language can cause Deaf people to have:  
Cognitive delays  
Mental health difficulties  
Lower Quality of life  
Higher trauma  
Limited health literacy  
They still have average/ above avg nonverbal intelligence tho get fucked  
Given an early language, Deaf children can still:  
Label experiences and concepts  
Reorganize new patterns based on new input (accommodation)  
Form new thoughts w/o real world experience
 
GIVE CHILDREN LANGUAGE EARLY!!!!!  
Without it, they cant develop thinking + social skills to their max potential
 
COGNITIVE ABILITIES  
Cognitive abilities are shaped by culture  
Thinking and lang are developed in family circle first  
Some families + professionals DON’T see the benefits of a sign language or multilingualism for deaf children???  
Vision, Hearing = distant senses  
Tactile-Kinesthetic = close senses
 
Kinesthetic-Tactile learning takes time  
Requires multiple exposures to learn  
DeafBlind children move through a hierarchy of tactile-kinesthetic skills  
Ranges from concrete, real objects to abstractions like braille.  
KT skills can help Dead people in poor lighting
 
ALL THESE METHODS OF GATHERING INFO SHAPE THINKING, LANGUAGE, AND LEARNING SKILLS  
Perceptions feed skills such as:  
Visual attention  
Tactile Attention  
Imagery  
Visual-Spatial Skills  
Memory  
Learning  
Metacognition  
Theory of Mind  
Executive Functioning  
Etc.
 
INCIDENTAL LEARNING  
Incidental learning + world knowledge are picked up thru conversation.  
This can be a problem for Deaf children if their parents don’t sign  
Causes delays in language and conceptual & world knowledge  
Deaf-Disabled individuals are profoundly affected.  
DeafBlind individuals don’t "overhear" or "oversee" environmental info.  
Teachers must set up direct opportunities to learn then, as opposed to incidental learning  
DeafDisabled individuals can still learn incidentally w/ accommodation
 
JOINT ATTENTION  
Using more than one sensory input at a time  
Telling bedtime stories to build concepts, language, and early literacy  
"Deaf children who have autism, are DeafBlind, or are both DeafBlind and autistic may access and process sensory information differently from sighted Deaf children. This impacts how they develop thinking skills and learn language"
 
Visual Attention and Peripheral Vision  
Deaf people have the same abilities when it comes to seeing color and distinguishing flashing items and visual motion  
Deaf individuals have better peripherals  
Can make Deaf children appear easily distracted and inattentive  
Large class sizes + vertical rows of seating are inaccessible  
Small class sizes + semicircular seating is the most accessible  
DeafBlind individuals need extra classroom rules for accessibility  
Mostly extra time to process or sign
 
TACTILE SELECTIVENESS:  
Avoiding certain textures based on faulty info or neurological complications\
 
Visual Imagery and Spatial Memory  
Signing Deaf students better at visual imagery, visuospatial memory, and remembering moving objects compared to hearing students. Also can change visual attention, scan visual material, detect motion, and recognize faces better.
 
Deaf children use visual memory to learn language, read and write, and study other subjects  
Worse at remembering numbers, printed words, and pictures  
Better at recognizing unfamiliar faces and remembering paths of light  
In general, Deaf signers from birth show better memory on visuospatial tasks that don’t require lang.  
This changes with other DeafDisabled students  
They may use visual, auditory, and/or tactile-kinesthetic memory skills for learning.  
May use Braille, large print, raised print, ASL, protactile, Signed English, Tactile Signed English, or some combination  
￼REASONING  
"Reasoning abilities such as logical reasoning, numerical and spatial reasoning, critical thinking, empathy, use of analogy for learning, and creativity may be challenging for Deaf students because of lack of early language access"  
Leads to difficulty in understanding cause and effect events in math, social studies, and science
 
**METACOGNITIVE ABILITIES**
 
**Theory of Mind**  
The ability to understand other's feelings, intentions, and emotions  
Basically empathy  
Mother's sign language proficiency correlates with Deaf children's ToM skills  
Isolation from communication and lang acquisition delays ToM skills  
DeafBlind individuals especially struggle with TOM  
Struggle developing attachment, empathy, and friendships w/ peers & siblings  
This combined w/ mood disorders = "their own classroom placement"  
Doesn't this make the lack of ToM skills worse?
 
**Executive Function**  
Skills used to get organized, control behavior to be effective, and problem solve  
Develop early from everyday conversations  
No early lang acq leads to being easily distracted, difficulty finishing projects, and poor EF skills  
Deaf children with good EF skills can:  
Control impulses and emotions  
Are flexible in adversity  
Learn from past mistakes  
Correct behavior
 
Both EF and ToM can be taught thru signed convos.  
Learning and applying EF and ToM is especially difficult for DeafBlind and DeafAutistic individuals  
They don’t see gestures or regulate emotions for themselves  
They also don’t practice improving these skills  
Use orientation and mobility exercises to let them interact w/ the environment more
   

LANGUAGE PATHWAYS  
Language can be acquired through ears, eyes, etc.  
Hearing results in babies parsing and segmenting sounds, syllables, words, etc  
Seeing results in babies parsing and segmenting handshapes, movements, positions, etc.  
Learning happens by age 4, including multilingualism
 
Early Gestures, Family Communication, and Play  
"Both hearing and Deaf babies use gestures, vocalizations, naming of objects, and actions to build communication that assists in their development of language, thinking, and social skills"  
Deaf children can learn sign anywhere from early childhood to young adulthood  
Hearing families often learn sign alongside their children  
Not as fluent, but still v helpful to child  
"Parents who have not fully learned a sign language can still communicate with their deaf children through eye gaze, joint attention, gesturing, and play, as well as drawing and writing activities"  
Developing a language > able to use symbolic behavior or lang in play
 
LANGUAGE MILESTONES  
Deaf babies stop babbling at 6-7 months  
speaking babies have baby talk  
signing babies have baby sign  
Languages will be blended together until multilingual children can discriminate between audiences  
"Language-deprived deaf children may have difficulty in conversational turn-taking, asking for clarification, or communicating to the teacher what they do not know "
 
The Brain, Multilingualism, and Sign Languages  
Both spoken AND signed languages stimulate the same parts of the brain  
Code-Blend: saying the same thing in speech and sign at the same time  
Codeswitching: completely switching from 1 lang to another  
Deaf children of deaf parents use both  
"The best time to receive exposure to multiple languages for children, both Deaf and hearing, is before age 5"
 
THEORIES AND STRATEGIES  
20% of Americans are bilingual  
43% of the world is bilingual  
Linguistic Interdependence and Threshold Theory (LITT)  
All language learners have a Common Underlying Proficiency (CUP)  
The first language (L1) supports the learning of the second language (L2)  
Dynamic model of bilingualism  
Langs don’t build off each other, but rather have a "unitary linguistic repertoire", using ALL lang as a resource  
Translanguaging: using lang resources from all known languages while communicating
 
LITERACY LEARNING  
IMPORTANCE  
Most Deaf people widely use smartphones for communication, which is in English  
Learn to read English at the very least  
DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS  
Takes deaf children 3-4 years longer to start reading  
Deaf students graduate HS w/ a 4th grade reading level  
Artifact of tests designed for English monolinguals, not that Deaf people can't comprehend
 
2 models proposed to teach Deaf people to read  
DEFECIT MODEL  
Deaf children learn to read orally/aurally?  
Test for the child's defecits, and give exercises to improve them  
ASSET MODEL  
Print literacy can be built upon existing sign language  
Deaf children recognize patterns in sign, so use that  
Develop ASL vocab to bridge to English words & learn segmented printed letters when reading words  
Develop sign phonological awareness to map written characters to meaning  
"These frameworks presented here do not suggest deaf children will never need the sound system or phonology of English to further develop reading skills"  
Connecting signs w/ printed words is practiced in 15 countries w/ 14 sign languages & 12 spoken languages
 
"Deaf children who have no language are able to invent their own system of gestures to express their feelings, wants, and needs"

"During the preschool years, deaf children learn language and play with siblings and peers. In the elementary years, they use their EF to pay attention, apply what they learn to new situations, and control their emotions, impulses, and social behaviors. Later they use metacognitive aspects of EF for planning, reasoning and judgment, reading, and writing "

"In fact, all children have the biological capacity or innate ability to learn language (Chomsky, 1965)."

Teacher reads the sentence/story and translates into ASL with expansions. Uses more than one sign to explain a meaning of a sign or a word. Teacher uses sign, fingerspelling, writing, pictures, and gestures to introduce Or emphasize a specific concept Or term. Sandwiching is similar to using chaining; however, in this case, a purposeful and specific sequence of equivalent meaning using sign, fingerspelling, writing, pictures, and gestures, for example, sign, word, sign or sign, fingerspelling, sign, etc. Teacher identifies words or groups of words that represent one unit of meaning or one sign in ASL and following a discussion Of appropriate translation. Summary of lesson presented in ASL, reading the lesson in English, followed by discussion in ASL. Teacher uses one language, then switches to another language. The teacher signs a summary of a story. Then children read the print version of the story, then discuss. Teacher provides lesson in ASL, then student responds using English Or vice versa.

[ON LEARNING TO READ] "They learn how to segment words into sounds (phonemic awareness) and then map their spoken language onto print in order to “crack the code” or learn the “alphabetic principle.” This process leads them to understand the grapheme (letter) to phoneme (sound) connection. After they do this, they can read or decode any new print words that they already know in their language."

The key to remember is that parents, educators, and professionals must provide Deaf individuals, including those who are DeafDisabled, with early access to communication and language.
