Identity changes over time (a 6 y/o girl /= a 20 y/o girl
 
DEAF IDENTITIES  
Personal Identity v Core Identity  
Personal Identities start with the family of origin  
How Deaf children integrate with the Deaf community depends on how the parents involve them  
Not Necessarily a core identity because it may be ethnically or racially based
 
CATEGORIES OF DEAF IDENTITIES  
Deaf vs deaf  
Hard of Hearing  
Hearing impaired  
Late deafened
 
DISABILITY FRAMEWORK  
1986 Weinberg & Sterritt  
Hearing Identification = able-bodied  
Deaf Identification = disabled  
Dual Identification = identification w/ both  
Deaf Identity Scale  
Most identify as Dual ID  
SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY  
1981 Tajfel  
Group relationships and social orientations are important for identity  
"imma avoid this group because theyre nerds"  
"imma join this group because theyre empowering"  
"researchers found that the majority of the students (37.1%) were socially oriented to both hearing and deaf peers, while 30.3% were mostly oriented to deaf peers and 12.4% were oriented to hearing peers " (20.2% unoriented)
 
"language and communication competence help support relationships"
 
RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

![Stages of Development Stage 1: Stage 2: Stage 3: Stage 4: Stage 5: Preencounter or Conformity Dissonance/Encounter Resistance and Immersion Internalization/lntrospection Integrative Awareness Description Believes that one should integrate into the majority culture. This means conforming to its values. Most often this means conforming to white culture values. The person experiences or hears about discrimination. There is realization that conforming to the majority culture is not going to work. The person starts the process of thinking differently about her or his racial/ cultural identity. The person supports only the minority culture and goes against the majority culture. Racism, oppression, and discrimination are important topics. Feelings are very strong. The minority identity is internalized and appreciated. The person now feels more comfortable atX)ut reaching out to other groups. Can appreciate oneself, feels secure inside, and can appreciate other cultures. Recognizes the strengths and problems in each culture. ](SEM1/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-1.png)  

"The stage model does not always follow in sequence. Can you explain why? Do all Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color start with Stage 1 or not?"
 
DEAF IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK  
1996 Neil Glickman modified the chart above for Deaf communities

![Stages of Development Stage 1: Stage 2: Stage 3: Stage 4: Culturally Hearing Marginal Immersion Bicultural Description Being deaf is seen as a medical problem to be fixed. It is better to conform to how hearing people act with each other and to follow hearing culture. This means focusing on spoken language, not signed language, and trying to be able to understand speech through hearing aids or cochlear implants. There may be denial about being deaf. The person has trouble connecting with hearing or deaf people. There is little connection with either hearing or Deaf cultures. There is enthusiastic embrace of everything Deaf. Deaf culture is the best. Hearing culture is rejected. There is a balanced perspective about both Deaf and hearing cultures. The person can comfortably interact in both Deaf and hearing cultures. Strengths and weaknesses in both cultures are recognized. ](SEM1/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-2.png)  

Sequence usually differs depending on parental situation  
The key to being well-adjusted is ease of communication & friends
 
ACCULTURATION MODEL  
Based on the immigration experience  
Acquiring a new culture is acculturation

![Acculturation Strategies 1. Assimilation Strategy 2. Separation Strategy 3. Integration Strategy 4. Marginalization Strategy Description Give up the home culture identity and work to fully interact with the new culture. Hold on to the home culture identity. Avoid interacting with the new culture. Hold on to the home culture identity. At the same time, work on interacting with the new culture. Little interest in maintaining cultural identity with either the home culture or the new culture. ](SEM1/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-3.png)  

These strats parallel racial identity development categories

![Acculturation Domains 1. Cultural Identification 2. Cultural Involvement 3. Cultural Preferences 4. Language Competence 5. Cultural Knowledge Description Psychological identification with deaf or hearing people. Who are you most comfortable with: deaf or hearing people? How much is one involved in Deaf cultural activities or in hearing cultural activities? Do you prefer to be with Deaf or with hearing people? How well does one sign and understand a signed language, for example, ASL? And how well does one speak and understand the spoken language, for example, English? How well do you know Deaf culture, such as favorite jokes? Hearing culture, such as nursery rhymes? ](SEM1/DFST101/Deaf%20Culture%20Notes/Ch.6%20Deaf%20Identities.md%201/Exported%20image%2020240525202844-4.png)  

THE NARRATIVE APPROACH  
Identities based on surveys and measures are too limiting  
Listen to a person's stories and extrapolate identity from that

![Phases in Deaf Identity Development Phase 1: Taken-for-Granted Phase Phase 2: Alienation Phase Phase 3: Affiliation Phase Phase 4: Deaf-in-My-Own-Way Phase Description Taking for granted I am like hearing people. Even if I meet deaf persons, I still feel I am like hearing people. Acknowledging that hearing people don't understand me and I don't understand them. I start to recognize Deaf as an identity and want to connect with Deaf people as we understand each Other. Hearing people become different. I am more comfortable with both Deaf and hearing people. I try to help hearing people understand me as a Deaf person. ](Exported%20image%2020240525202844-5.png)  

INTERSECTIONALITY  
How race, class, gender, etc. intersect and create the potential for overlapping discriminatory experiences.
 
Race/ Ethnicity  
Early core identity (other than gender)  
Deaf identity usually develops alongside Race identity  
Double minorities lol  
"Each group membership requires following different norms, behavior, and values"  
"Deaf becomes more relevant when he is in a situation where there is communication difficulty, like with hearing people at work. Black becomes more relevant when he is with white people, whether hearing or deaf, either in school or at a Deaf festival"  
Sexual Orientation  
Being Deaf, LGBTQA, and an Ethnic minority is rough lol  
Hard to find acceptance  
Disability  
40-50% of Deaf population has additional disabilities  
Can make people be outcast from Deaf community  
"Some of these individuals may have to rely on significant others such as parents or caretakers for activities of daily living or access to information. If these significant others do not accept them, they may have difficulty developing a sense of trust in themselves and a strong identity that includes their additional disability, their being deaf, and everything else about themselves"  
You don’t really see other deaf people with the same disability as you

![As a deaf person in a hearing fam- ily, Tina knew she was different as a deaf person early on because of her mother being hearing, as she explained it. Tina was not really conscious about herself being Black until she entered a school for the deaf where almost everyone was white (Mauldin & Fannon, 2020). ](Exported%20image%2020240525202844-6.png)
