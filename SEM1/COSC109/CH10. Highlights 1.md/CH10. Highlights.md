Digital cameras are adopted bc  
Higher resolution  
Higher print quality  
More reliable  
Easier to use  
Better storage methods  
More software compatible
 
Digital cameras come in 3 varieties:  
Consumer  
Point-and-shoot  
Camera auto focuses and exposes  
Can be up to 10-14 megapixels  
Prosumer  
Blend of consumer and professional  
DSLRs with interchangeable lenses  
More exposure control  
Usually higher res than consumer  
Professional  
All the benefits, but even more so  
Lenses behave differently on a pro's full-frame sensor  
Roughly equivalent to 35mm film
 
VIDEO CAMERAS  
Can capture still images  
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use video cameras for video and cameras for still images  
Video cameras pick up audio better and cameras are a higher res
 
IMAGING CHAIN  
4 parts:  
Lens  
Determines FOV  
Controls magnification  
Ground glass or molded plastic  
Affects sharpness and clarity  
Prime, Normal, Novelty, and Zoom Lenses  
Primes have a fixed focal length  
Wide angles  
Short focal length  
18-35mm for full frame  
Wide angle of view  
"short lenses"  
Telephotos  
Long focal length  
90-300mm for full frame  
Narrow angle of view  
"long lenses"  
Magnify objects  
Normals  
Medium focal length  
40-60mm for full frame  
Middle ground  
Good for general shooting  
Noveltys  
Descriptive names like macro and fisheye  
Designed for atypical shooting situations  
Macros  
Focus really close to subject  
Good for extreme close-ups  
Fisheyes  
Extremely short focal length  
8-15mm  
Offers up to 180 degree angle of view  
Significantly distorted  
Super-telephoto lenses  
400-600mm for full frame  
Narrowest angle of view  
Extremely high levels of image magnification  
Zooms  
Variable focal-length  
Ex. Anywhere between 28mm-300mm  
Usually inferior image quality  
Iris  
Regulates exposure intensity  
Adjustable plastic or metal diaphragm  
Regulates amount of light striking the image sensor  
Usually located between elements of the lens  
NOT aperture, that’s the hole the iris makes  
Shutter  
Regulates time of exposure  
Movable curtain, plate, or other device that controls the amount of time the image sensor is exposed to light  
Shutter speed is the length of time the shutter is open  
Ranges from 1/8000 - several seconds  
Image Sensor  
Captures light and converts it into a digital signal  
Small electronic chip used to register intensity and color of film  
Digital equivalent of film  
Size  
35mm = most popular SLR format  
36x24mm  
Full-frame is 3x2, just like 36x24mm  
Smaller cameras contain smaller image sensors  
Focal Length Multiplier  
Larger sensors offer wider angle of view than smaller ones
 
IMAGE RESOLUTION  
12 megapixel camera = 3000x4000px  
Called native resolution  
Can be downscaled to like 1600x1200 or 640x480
 
IMAGE ENCODING AND COMPRESSION  
Consumer cameras use JPEG  
Prosumer and professional support JPEG, but usually use TIFF or Camera RAW  
Larger, but save more raw data for higher quality images  
RAW > TIFF > JPEG  
TIFF & JPEG are easier to work with  
Compression is a thing lol  
JPEG can take a 3.8mb file and turn it to 700kb  
RAWs can be up to 10mb
    
"Photographically, the decisive moment is that instant when an action is at its peak, when it’s stronger than it was the moment before or will be the moment after"
 
EXPOSURE  
The product of 2 variables  
Intensity of light (controlled by the iris)  
Duration of contact w/ image sensor (controlled by shutter speed)  
This relationship is called the reciprocity law
 
Exposure = Intensity * Time  
1/250 @ f/8 is the same as  
1/125 @ f/11 is the same as  
1/500 @ f/5.6
 
MEASURING LIGHT INTENSITY  
Digital cameras have built in exposure meters  
3 different metering methods to compensate for diff lighting scenarios  
EVALUATIVE METERING MODE  
Evaluates at various points and combines results w/ other data to determine best exposure  
Default method  
Best overall results, esp. in unevenly lit scenes  
CENTER-WEIGHTED METERING MODE  
Same as evaluating, but sample points are mostly in the center  
Recommended for scenes where the main subject is backlit or surrounded by bright background objects  
SPOT METERING MODE  
Calculates exposure based on light intensity of the main subject in the center of the screen  
Best for high contrast-scenes w/ varying levels of brightness
 
Most camera's flashes work up to 15 feet  
They also wash out color  
Fill Flash  
Auto Flash  
Red-eye Reduction
 
EXPOSURE TRIANGLE  
Aperture (FSTOP)  
f/16 means the diameter of the aperture is equal to 1/16th the focal length of the lens  
Larger number = smaller hole  
"Opening the aperture by one full f-stop (e.g., changing from f/11 to f/8) doubles the size of the aperture and the amount of light striking the image sensor. "  
ISO  
Logarithmic  
Describes a sensor's ability to respond to light  
Higher ISO adds grain  
Shutter speed  
Use slower shutter speed with minimal motion  
Use higher shutter speed with lots of motion  
Combine to make the Exposure Value (EV)
 
WHITE BALANCE  
Light sources are rated according to their color temp on the kelvin scale  
Electronic image sensors have to be calibrated to color temp to accurately capture color  
Called white balance  
Manual white balance is just like sticking a sheet of paper in the scene and letting the camera adjust to "true white"  
Most accurate  
Must be redone every time lighting conditions change  
Auto White Balance (AWB)
 
FOCUS  
Focus control is used to define the sharpness of an object w/in the frame by changing the distance between the optical elements of a lens.  
Focus must be reset each time the distance between camera and subject changes
 
AUTOFOCUS (AF)  
Active AF  
IR lights scan objects within 25 feet  
Works in virtual darkness  
Passive AF  
More sophisticated, more accurate  
Charge-coupled device (CCD) detects and analyzes changes in the contrast of image pixels  
Must have sufficient light & contrast
 
AF TARGET POINT  
Set to the center of the frame by default  
Focus object in center, then move to where you want
 
Neither active or passive are foolproof  
Problems usually occur when:  
Near + distant objects are mixed together  
Objects are moving  
Extremely bright lights/ subject areas  
Monochromatic scenes
 
MANUAL FOCUS (MF)  
Spinning da little ring on da lens  
Use manual when subject is 35+ feet away or when auto don’t work
 
DEPTH OF FIELD (DOF)  
Refers to the area in front of and behind the subject in focus  
Great DOF = everything is sharply defined  
Shallow DOF = noticeable portions are out of focus
 
Largely affected by 3 main variables

1. F-Stop
    
    1. Aperture inversely related to DOF
2. Lens's focal length
    
    1. Inversely related to DOF
3. Distance from camera to subject
    
    1. DOF increases w/ distance
 
EXPOSURE MODES  
Range from fully automatic to fully manual
 
AUTOMATIC MODES  
Fully Automatic Mode  
Auto shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance, focus, and flash  
Significantly reduces the photographer's role in the creative process  
Portrait Mode  
Optimized for shooting close-ups w/ a shallow DOF  
Auto raises shutter speed and widens aperture  
Landscape Mode  
Optimized for wide shots w/ large DOF  
Auto tightens aperture and lowers shutter speed  
Sports Mode  
Fast shutter speed  
Used for moving objects  
Night Mode  
Slow shutter speed + flash  
Use a tripod to eliminate blur
 
SEMI-AUTOMATIC MODES  
Aperture Priority Mode  
F-stop determined manually, rest auto  
Controls for DOF  
Shutter Priority Mode  
Shutter Speed determined manually, rest auto  
Controls for motion blur  
Program Mode  
Auto calculate aperture and shutter speed  
Things like ISO, white balance, flash, etc. are still manual
 
MANUAL MODE  
Full Manual Mode  
All settings are manual  
Requires the most skill and knowledge  
Greatest degree of creative control
 
IMAGE STABILIZATION  
Use tripods to lessen blur lol  
Blur is worse at slow shutter speeds and long focal lengths  
Video from a tripod should be the norm
 
Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)  
Shift pixel matrix in the direction of camera movement  
Leaves behind artifacts
 
Solid State Memory Cards  
Many formats
 
CompactFlash (CF) Card  
Holds up to over 100GB  
Secure Digital (SD) card  
SD: up to 2GB  
SDHC: 2GB-32GB  
SDXC: 32GB-2TB  
MultiMediaCard (MMC)  
Memory Stick (MS)
 
TRANSFERRING AND MANAGING IMAGES

"All things being equal, increasing film speed by one ISO level has the same effect on exposure as opening the aperture by one full stop"
