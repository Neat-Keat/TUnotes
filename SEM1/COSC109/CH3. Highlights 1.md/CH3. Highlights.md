CREATIVITY
 
Creativity is a process that "involves the production of novel, useful products".  
A formal process is necessary for translating sophisticated ideas into useful multimedia products
 
AUDIENCE
 
Claude Shannon + Warren Weaver **linear** theory of communications (1948)

1. Information source (sender)
2. Message (content)
3. Transmitter (encodes message)
4. Channel (transmits message)
5. Receiver (decodes message)
6. Destination (recipient
7. Noise and feedback

"mother of all models"  
Adapted into various versions, like Schram's SMCR (source, message, channel, receiver)  
Most models see source as dominant party and receiver as least influential.  
Planning process takes input from producers and stakeholders, not audience.
 
Social category theory argues that broad subgroups react similarly to mass media  
Target market = target audience
 
USERS
 
Calling receivers users is more multipurpose than audience  
Many planning models to choose from.
 
THE THREE Ps
 
Preproduction  
Production  
Postproduction
 
Inherently linear
 
**PREPRODUCTION:**  
Planning and prep phase of a project  
Breaks down into individual tasks and processes, like:  
Problem identification and needs assessment  
Concept development  
Research  
Audience analysis  
Scriptwriting  
Budgeting  
Hiring production crew members  
Auditioning and casting talent  
Location scouting  
Production scheduling  
Equipment rental  
Etc.  
Meant to establish scope, direction, time frame, and cost before spending money  
Saves time and money  
Corporate Producing: The Client and Producer Model  
Clients are content experts, they are most familiar with mission, goals, and needs  
Producer are message-design experts, they are most familiar with process and tools to craft an effective message and strategic deployment  
Entertainment and News Producing  
Executive producer vs producer  
EP is a top level management position, they oversee multiple projects simultaneously  
Primarily concerned with business, and report up the corporate ladder  
P is in charge of 1 project at a time  
More active role in influencing content, actual tasks vary widely  
Previsualization  
Describes the act of putting a story idea or concept into a written or illustrated form that can be shared with others.  
Linear stories use 3 devices:  
**TREATMENT**  
Short narrative description of a project. Gives readers a concise written summary  
Addresses who, what, when, where, and why questions  
Often used in pitching narrative film and video projects  
Similar in purpose to an executive summary or resume.  
Can describe ANY multimedia project  
**STORYBOARD**  
Combines words and pictures together to communicate an idea  
Organized panel of images and text used for previsualizing a linear or nonlinear sequence of actions or steps  
Popularized by Walt Disney in the 1930s  
**SCRIPT**  
Written narrative framework for organizing visual and audio portions of a multimedia presentation.  
Often used for time-based media projects / interactive narratives  
AV SCRIPT FORMAT:  
2 column format ideal for radio/TV commercials, music videos, promo videos, education and training programs, docs, interactive narratives, and more  
Most common and versatile script format used today  
Left column takes up 1/3 of the page and includes info abt the video portion  
Right column takes up 2/3 of the page and includes info abt the audio portion (music cues, voiceover copy, actor dialog  
Used in single and multi camera productions!  
SCREENPLAY FORMAT:  
Used in Hollywood  
Single column layout  
One page = one minute  
Highly prescriptive  
Must be followed precisely at the risk of being rejected on technical grounds.  
Usually uses professional scriptwriting software to conform to industry standards  
**PRODUCTION:**  
Acquisition phase of a project when all the physical media is shot or recorded either on location or in studio  
Just as producers, writers, and designers lead Preproduction, so too do Directors lead the Production  
Includes:  
Director  
Director of Photography  
Camera Operator  
Focus Puller  
Production Sound mixer or sound recordist  
Gaffer or lighting director  
Grip -assists mechanical rigging of structural supports, moves cameras, etc  
Script Supervisor  
Production coordinator/manager  
Production assistant  
**POSTPRODUCTION**  
Assembly phase of a project  
Traditionally spent almost entirely on video and audio editing and mixing  
Also includes the creation of titles, motion graphics, VFX, etc.  
ROUGH CUT: 1st complete edited version of a program or a revision before the final cut  
Ch14 covers post in more detail
 
USER CENTERED DESIGN (UCD)  
Product of human-computer interaction  
More of a philosophy and mindset of developing interfaces than a step-by-step process  
About creating a product that meets the needs of real users instead of designer's whims  
Doesn’t require adaptation to a new interface

Uses user's existing behaviors and thought processes to create an intuitive and natural interaction experience  
ISO in 2008 introduced ISO 9241-210 – Ergonomics of human-system interaction: Human-centerd design for interactive systems. Its based on 6 fundamental principles of human-centered design

2. Design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments
3. Users are involved throughout design and development
4. The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation
5. The process is iterative
6. The design addresses the whole user experience
7. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives
 
Three Ps is top down and focuses on producer and stakeholder desires  
UCD puts the user at the center at every step
 
Putting Principles into Practice  
The User Experience Professionals Association (UXPA) promotes a 4 phase methodology

1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Deployment

Kickoff meeting between client team and project team, both have designated leaders  
Ask a shit ton of questions to get an idea of what the client wants  
Needs Assessment, Facts Gathering, and Research  
For who? Budget? Any specifics? What's your mission? Etc.  
Benchmarking: look at similar projects to compare scope to  
Identify target users  
Specify project requirements  
Conduct research and assimilate data  
Begins with brainstorming and basic concepts, structures, and content for the multimedia experience  
Card Sorting:  
Use notecards to show how content should be organized hierarchically  
Wireframe:  
Visual representation of the layout or skeletal structure of a page  
Consult with clients to see what they think  
Mockup:  
Next step after a wireframe gets approved  
More refined, actual-size, created by a graphic designer  
JUST A PNG, not a working prototype  
Can illustrate color scheme and style elements of a page  
3+ is a good starting point  
Prototype:  
Paper or working model of the project designed for simulation and testing  
Once approved, the design team can move on to actual construction  
Process of turning the approved final version of a working prototype or mockup into a fully functional website, app, or interface  
Building a working product or system that is ready to be tested on a server, computer, or mobile device  
Once complete, do usability tests again and revise!  
Involves publishing content or software to end users.
   

1 & 2 ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT, FOCUS ON THEM PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

Target group vs ancillary users  
Target group is who you intend to use a product  
Ancillary users use a product for other reasons
