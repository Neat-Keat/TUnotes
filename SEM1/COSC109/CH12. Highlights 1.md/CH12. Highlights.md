SOUND AND AUDIO
 
Sound on Tape (SOT)  
Audio captured on location at the time of a video or film recording
 
What is Sound?
 
Sound: a natural phenomenon that involves pressure and vibration  
Sound Waves: a special type of energy and require a molecular medium for propagation
 
Sound is measured in amplitude and frequency  
Represent volume and pitch
 
AMPLITUDE
 
Distance from crest to trough of a wave  
Bigger is louder, smaller is quieter  
Diminishes over time  
Measured in decibels (dB)  
We can hear from 0-120 dB  
An increase of 20 dB = 10x perceived volume  
Pain begins at 140  
Permanent hearing loss at 150  
Ringing in your ears is tinnitus and can be permanent  
Dynamic range: quietest -> loudest sound
 
FREQUENCY
 
Compression -> crest  
Rarefaction -> trough  
Rest -> baseline  
Issa cycle
 
Frequency = # of cycles/second, measured in hertz (Hz) or kilohertz (kHz)  
We can perceive 20-20,000 Hz  
Bass > 20-320 Hz  
Midrange > 320-5120 Hz  
Treble > 5120-20000 Hz
 
Microphones
 
Equalization: raising or lowering the gain of each frequency region
 
How do Microphones Work?
 
Transduction: convert acoustic waveforms into electrical voltage signals w/ appropriate amplitude and frequency
 
Mics are classified to 3 main features:

1. Transduction method
    
    1. Dynamic
        
        Uses acoustical energy and mechanical vibration as the means for producing the electromagnetic signal required for analog recording
        
        - Don’t require a power source
        - Durable, relatively inexpensive, moisture & shock resistant
    2. Condenser
2. Polar Pattern (pickup pattern)
3. Form Factor
    
    4 general mic styles
    
    2. Handheld
    3. Lavalier (lapel)
    4. Shotgun
    5. Boundary (pressure zone mics (PZMs))

Moving Coil  
Diaphragm is attached to a coil, suspended in a magnetic field between the north and south poles of a fixed magnet.  
Diaphragm is a thin, circular membrane, usually paper, plastic, or metal.  
As it vibrates, the coil oscillates in the magnetic field, producing a tiny current that's transmitted via copper wire to the mic cable. The electromagnetic signal modulates in unison with the amplitude and frequency of the sound pressure wave, producing a copy of the original waveform.  
Ribbon  
Thin metal ribbon of corrugated metal, usually aluminum, as transduction element. It generates an electromagnetic current when it pulsates in the mag field.. Technically superior because they respond to sound bidirectionally.  
Relatively expensive, superior performance and natural sound reproduction. Picks up a lot of wind and old models are fragile  
Both rely on electromagnetic induction (use magnets to produce electric current)  
Uses a capacitor to record variations in amplitude and frequency  
2 parts: back plate (with the electric charge), and the diaphragm.  
As diaphragm vibrates, it moves closer & further from back plate, changing voltage intensity.  
Much more sensitive to sound than dynamic mics  
2 groups based on diaphragm size  
Large  
Bigger form factor  
Used in studio recording environment  
Small  
Smaller profile  
Used in field AND studio environments  
Require power source to electrify back plate  
Can be powered with _phantom power_, an electric current transmitted to mic from an attached mixer or recording device. +48V charge thru signal wires of XLR cable  
Electret Condenser Mic  
Back plate is permanently charged, eliminating the need for external power.  
How well a mic picks up sound in a 360 degree radius (in 3D!)  
6 main patterns:  
Omnidirectional  
Mic body can block, use in situations with little to no ambient noise  
Bidirectional  
Most ribbon mics, ideal for interviews  
Cardioid  
Best in areas with a lot of ambient noise. Ideal for single subjects and vocalists  
Supercardioid  
Hypercardioid  
Ultracardioid  
Designed to be held, must be held close to mouth. Minimizes noise caused by sudden movement, rough handling. Work best when no further than 6 inches away from mouth and slightly off-axis. Too close causes plosives too far causes no sound  
Popular for interviews. Highly sensitive to sound and touch. Attach to clothing 3-6 inches below the chin. Place it properly and hide the wires pls thx  
Relatively expensive, but versatile in complicated situations, esp. where more than 1 person is talking. Can remain hidden out of frame easily. Uses boom poles! Can be attached to a pistol grip for handheld control. Secure them to a sturdy shock mount to reduce mechanical transmission noise. Require power. If you can only have 1 mic, go with a shotgun.  
Condenser mics intended to be placed on a flat surface, usually a table, ceiling, or wall. Capsule is affixed above a metal baseplate and detects changes in the sound pressure waves within the air gap, called the pressure zone. Usually used to record meetings and conferences and are good for recording multiple people at the same time
 
BUILT IN OR EXTERNAL MICS?
 
Built ins are usually low-end condenser mics. Don’t use built-ins to record without testing first. Harder to position.
 
No substitute for professional external mics. Better transducers and components
 
Why use External Mics?

1. Select the best type from a vast assortment of pro mics to fit recording setting, subject, and application
2. Greater control over placement and proximity
3. Better specs
4. Use a balanced XLR connector, better for reducing RF interference and transmission noise
 
WIRELESS MICS
 
Sometimes you can plug regular mics into a wireless transmitter.  
May lose some frequency range.  
Make sure you have back-up batteries :skull:  
Make sure multiple mics arent on the same radio frequency
 
2 transmitter types for pro equipment, UHF and VHF  
UHF has the most available frequencies, helpful with 5+ wireless mics, more expensive  
some frequencies overlap with TV station frequencies  
Infrared transmitters also exist, but avoid them bc they require line of sight lulw
 
USB Mics
 
Use an analog-to-digital converter instead of plugging straight into computer. Isolates conversion process and lessens the chance of unwanted noise from PC hardware. Most USB connectors have a A/D converter built in
 
AUDIO CONNECTORS  
Pro mics use balanced connectors, consumer devices use unbalanced connectors
 
BALANCED AUDIO CONNECTORS  
3 wires encased in a rubber sheath. Audio signals flow from mic to recorder and back again.  
A pair of twisted wires is used for conducting the signal path. Current travels down the positive wire in 1 direction and returns on the negative wire in the opposite direction. Current resistance is the same both ways, so its balanced. 3rd wire is a ground, protects from electrical interference. Can run long distances with good results.
 
XLR CONNECTORS  
Balanced connectors usually have XLR connectors on each end of the wire. Female connector attaches directly to the end of the mic or power adapter, while 3-pin male connector plugs into recorder or mixer. Has a locking mechanism on the metal casing to keep it from coming loose during recording. NEVER pull directly on the cable when attempting to disconnect it
 
UNBALANCED AUDIO CONNECTORS  
Male end: plug  
Female end: jack  
Cable uses 2 wires, a center conductor surrounded by a shield. Positive wire conducts the outbound signal flow, while the negative wire functions as both the return conduit and ground. Highly susceptible to interference across long distances. 20 feet or less
 
TS and TRS connectors  
1/4 inch phono plug. Tip and Sleeve (TS) design. Originally used by telephone switchboard operators. Tip conducts positive phase while sleeve carries the negative phase and serves as the ground. Insulator ring separates the two. Stereo version uses tip, ring, and sleeve (TRS). Can be used to carry a balanced mono audio signal or an unbalanced stereo signal. come in 1/4 inch, 3.5mm, and 2.5mm plugs. Adapters exist lol
 
RCA Connectors  
Originally for phonographs to amplifiers. Now connects AV signals to AV devices. Color coded :skull:  
Yellow: Composite Video Channel  
Red: Right Audio Channel  
White: Left Audio Channel
 
ADAPTERS  
Best to avoid adapters. Mixing balanced and unbalanced audio gear is bad  
Adapters complicate matters, they introduce another potential failure point in the audio chain. Secure adapters with a small piece of gaffer tape to keep them from working lose during recording. Gaffer tape uses an adhesive that doesn’t leave a residue
 
CABLE MANAGEMENT 101  
Wrap and store cables properly  
Properly wrap and secure a cable when you're finished using it.  
Carefully wrapped in a uniform coil, 12-24 inches in diameter.  
Short cables less than 50 feet should have loops of 30-36 inches of wire.
 
Proper wrapping stops cables from twisting, kinking, creasing, or bending. Cables retain a memory based on patterns of repeated winding.
 
Audio Monitoring  
2 step-process

1. Objective act of measuring sound intensity and setting record levels
2. Subjective act of listening to the audio signal as its being recorded
 
MONITORING RECORD LEVELS W/ A VU METER (step1)  
Mics produce a very weak signal that needs to be amplified  
Preamp setting (record level) can be set for both left and right channels.  
Pro systems can use automatic gain control (AGC) OR manual volume-unit (VU) meter and record level controls Manual >  
Analog VU meters usually range from -20 dB to +3 dB  
Digital VU meters usually range from -48 dB to ?? dB  
Setting too high causes clipping/distortion  
Setting too low forces amplification in post, introducing noise
 
THE SOUND CHECK  
Have someone speak normally and adjust levels to peak at 0 dB
   

MONITORING WITH HEADPHONES OR SPEAKERS (step2)  
Set record levels first, then headphones
 
Headphones  
Invest in at least one set of good-quality headphones  
Over the ear, not earbud  
Keep headphones on when capturing audio.  
Cell Phones can wreak havoc if mics arent RF-shielded
