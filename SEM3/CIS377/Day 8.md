Technically a week behind schedule lol
 
Today we're doing Risk Management  
We're dropping secure software?
 
Final paper needs a presentation that covers paper's content
 
No hw this week!

RISK MANAGEMENT
 
The ID, assessment, and prioritization of risks

- ID, characterize threats
- Assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats
- Determine the risk
- ID ways to reduce those risks
- Prioritize risk reduction measures based on a strategy  
Risk management does NOT eliminate risks, it reduces them.
 
What is at risk?

- Networks – is someone on the network, capturing the data?
- Data – is it being taken or altered?
 
With respect to info systems?

- Potential harm that may arise from some current process or future event
- Process of understanding and responding to factors that may lead to failure in confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system/data
- Likelihood
- Threat
- Vulnerability
- Impact
 
Overview

- Know yourself
    
    - ID, examine, and understand the info and systems in place
- Know the enemy
    
    - ID, examine, and understand...
- Risk management does NOT eliminate risks
- Not all risks are created equal or should be treated the same
- Goal – ID risks, determine appropriate actions  
Key components

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
 
Threats conpromise any of these 3 aspects of info processed, stored, or transmitted by IT systems
 
RISK components

- Losses occur when a threat exposes a vulnerability
- Loss: results in a compromise to business functions or assets that adversely affects the business
    
    - Compromise of business functions – activities a business performs, can result in a loss of revenue
    - Compromise of business assets – anything of measurable value, tangible and intangible
    - Driver of business costs
 
Risk ID

- Risk is the likelihood that a loss will occur
- Losses occur when a threat exposes a vulnerability
- Threat – any activity that represents a possible danger
- Vulnerability
 
- To ID risks
    
    - ID threats
    - ID vulnerabilities
    - Estimate the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

…
 
Consider

- Confidentiality
    
    - Data at rest
    - Data in transmission
    - All data equal with requirements?
- Integrity
    
    - Versioning
    - Change management
- Availability
    
    - Backups (onsite and offsite)
    - Required hours of operation
 
Risk Management Process

1. Asset Identification
    
    1. People
        
        - Position name/number/ID
        - Supervisor
        - Security clearance level
        - Special skills
    2. Data and Information
        
        1. Owner/creator/manager
        2. Data structure size; data structure used
        3. Online/offline; location
        4. Backup procedures employed
        5. Classification scheme
    3. Procedures
        
        1. IT and business standard procedures
        2. IT and business sensitive procedures
        3. Asset attributes for procedures:
            
            1. Description
            2. Intended purpose
            3. What elements is it tied to?
            4. Storage location for reference
            5. Storage location for update
    4. Software & hardware
        
        1. Network name
        2. IP address
        3. MAC Address
        4. Element type
        5. Serial number
        6. Manufacturer name
        7. Model/part number
        8. Software version
        9. Physical or logical location
        10. Controlling entity
      
    6. Iterative process: begins with ID of assets, including all elements of an org's system (people, procedures, data and info, software, hardware, networking)
    7. Assets are then classified and categorized
      
    
2. Identify threats
    
    1. Realistic threats need investigation; unimportant threats are set aside
    2. Threat assessment:
        
        1. Which threats present danger to assets?
        2. Which threats represent the most danger to info?
        3. How much would it cost to recover from attack?
        4. Which threat …
    3. Threat = any activity that represents a possible danger or loss
    4. ID the threats
        
        - Internal / external
        - Natural or man-made
        - Intentional or accidental
    5. Use the vulnerabilities as a source
    6. Threat
        
        - A possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability to breach security and thus cause possible harm
        - …
        - …
    7. Categories
        
        - Human threats
            
            - Internal
                
                - Current or past employees
                - Intentional or unintentional
            - External
                
                - Hackers
                - Intentional or unintentional
                - Malware, DoS, terrorists
        - Natural Threats
            
            - Hurricane
            - Loss of power
        - "new" threats
            
            - Bring your own device (BYOD)
            - Cloud computing
            - Big data
    8. Threat Assessments
        
        - ID and evaluate potential threats
        - ID as many possible threats as possible
        - List will not be complete
        - ID most likely threats
        - Estimate frequency
        - Performed at a specific time
        - Evaluates current threats in an existing environment
    9. Best Practices
        
        - Assume nothing
        - Things change
        - Verify system operates as expected
        - Limit scope to 1 domain at a time
        - Use documentation and diagrams to understand
        - ID all entry points
        - Consider threats to the CIA triad
        - Consider internal and external human threats
        - Consider natural threats
          
        
    10. Review historical data
    11. Specific Info on past threats
        
        - Organization
            
            - Internal users
            - Disgruntled employee
            - Equipment failure
            - Software failure
            - Data loss
            - Attacks
        - Similar organizations
        - Local area (natural events)
    12. No guaranteed threats will be repeated
    13. No guarantee new threat won't appear
      
    15. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
    16. THINK LIKE AN ATTACKER
      
    
3. Identify vulnerabilities
    
    1. Specific avenues threat agents can exploit an attack an info asset are called vulnerabilities
    2. Examine how each threat could be perpetrated and list org's assets and vulnerabilities
    3. Process works best when people with diverse backgrounds within org work iteratively in a series of brainstorming sessions
    4. At end of risk ID process, list of assets and their vulnerabilities is achieved
      
    6. Human
    7. Operational – insufficient security procedures
    8. Info vulnerabilities
    9. Facility – weak physical location and geographical
    10. Equipment
      
    
    - Vulnerability = weakness
    - Where are vulnerabilities?
    - Sources for ID
    - Audits
    - Certification and accreditation (ATO, OSA)
    - System logs, scan reports
    - Incident response investigations
    - Use ALL IT domains
        
        - User – people
        - Workstation – end user's computer
        - Networks (LAN & WAN)
        - …
    
      
    
    Threat -> attack -> vulnerability -> Loss of Impact
    
      
    
    - The amount of risk an org is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives given consideration of costs and benefits
    - Provides guidance on the amount of risk that is acceptable in pursuit of objectives
    - Help make informed decisions
    - Decisions with regard to
        
        - Allocation of resources
        - Management controls
        - Potential consequences
        - Impacts to other parts of organization
          
        
    
    - The risk that remains after an attack
    - Residual risk = total risk - controls
    
4. Assess Risks
5. Determine Countermeasures
          
Vulnerability: weakness in an info system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source
 
Critical  
No known countermeasures and adversary capability exists (75-100%)  
High  
Some countermeasures, multiple weaknesses exist that adversaries could exploit (50-74%)  
Medium  
There are effective countermeasures in place, but adversaries can exploit a weakness (25-49%)  
Low  
Multiple levels of countermeasures exist and few or no adversaries could exploit the asset (0-24%)
   

Risk appetite
 
Residual risk
   

Mission Critical Systems

- What are they?
    
    - Any system or app that must continue to run to ensure business runs
    - Critical business function – vital to an org, if fails, CANNOT PERFORM ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS = monetary loss
- Relates to company mission and goal and how the system is used
    
    - Internet access?
    - Web server availability?
    - Data base server?
- What are the legal and compliance requirements? 
Info Asset Valuation

- Is most critical to an org's success
- Generates the most revenue/profitability?
- Would be most expensive to replace or protect?
- Would be most embarassing/...
 
Info Asset Valuation

- Critical
    
    - Compromise to assets would have grave consequences leading to loss of life, serious injury, or mission failure (50-100)
- High
    
    - Compromise to assets would have serious consequences that could impair operations for a significant period of time (13-50)
- Medium
    
    - Compromise to assets would have moderate consequences that impairs operations for a limited period of time (3-13)
- Low
    
    - Compromise to assets would have little or no impact on the continuation of operations (1-3)
 
Which info asset:
