My greatest customer service skill is my willingness to do the stuff no one else wants to do. I'll to go the extra mile, even in tasks most people wouldnâ€™t even start. Examples of my dedication are apparent in my volunteer work. As a middle schooler, I would help my grandparents bale hay all day, lifting bales about as heavy as I was with a smile on my face. In high school, my dad and I would walk along the roads in our area, picking up bag after bag of trash. We weren't getting paid for it, we just wanted to take pride in our community.
 
In addition, I would say I have experience as a leader. I was elected patrol leader of my local boy scout troop, and lead a handful of middle and high schoolers through weekend long camping trips across the east coast. I was also section leader of my high school's percussion ensemble for two years, serving as a role model for the 20+ other people in my section year-round.

As a future employee, I believe I have a lot to bring to the table. Most relevantly, I would say that my expertise in creating multimedia products is my biggest asset. I attended Cecil County School of Technology, a trade school which not only taught me how to use various professional-grade creation applications like Adobe Photoshop and Unity, but I also have Adobe's Creative Associate certificates in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Animate, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. I have used these skills to grow my own personal brand, having amassed 403.5 thousand likes on Tiktok with two videos reaching over a million views. If you hire me, I can use these skills not only to help develop your own social media identity, but also work on things like the frontend of your website or any advertising material you need.
