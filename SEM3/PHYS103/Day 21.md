last day of lecture 11/29  
Exam on 12/3  
Final 12/11
 
Chapter 11 – Magnetism and electrodynamics  
11.1 - household magnets
 
2 types of current

- Direct Current
- Alternating current  
Voltage = R * I  
Power = V * I  
Power = R * I^2
 
Negative to positive charge = voltage rise  
Happens at battery  
Positive to negative charge = voltage drop  
Happens at bulb

Household magnets
 
Observations

- They attract or repel depending on orientation
- Magnets stick only to certain metals
- Magnets affect compasses
- The earth is magnetic
- Some magnets require electricity
 
Questions

1. Why do any 2 magnets attract AND repel?
    
    1. Each magnet has both north and south poles
      
    
    Like poles repel, opposites attract  
    Magnetic pole is a conserved quantity
    
      
    
    The net pole on any object is always exactly zero!
    
      
      
    8. Unlike charges, free poles are never observed
    9. A magnet ALWAYS has equal north AND south poles
    10. It has magnetic polarization, but0 net pole
    11. A fragment of a magnet has a net pole of 0
      
    
2. Why must magnets be close to attract or repel?
    
    1. Forces are weakened between distance and cancellation
    2. Magnetostatic forces are
        
        - Proportional to the amount of each pole
        - Proportional to 1 / distance^2
          
        
    
    Each magnet has both north and south poles
    
      
    
3. Why do magnets stick only to some metals?
    
    1. Only a few metals are intrinsically magnetic
      
    
    Electrons have intrinsic magnetic dipoles
    
      
    
    Ferromagnetic materials have magnetic domains  
    A magnet can magnetize a steel fridge  
    Magnets thus stick to stele fridges
    
      
    
    Soft and hard magnetic materials
    
    - Have domains that grow or shrink easily, thus easy to magnetize/ demagnetize
    - Quickly forget previous magnetizations
    
4. Why does a magnetic compass point north?
    
    1. Earth's magnetic field twists it northward
      
    
    - Pushes north poles northward north, south poles south
    - Exerts torques on magnetic dipoles, like compasses
    
    - A structure in space and time at pushes on pole
    - A vector field
      
    
5. Why do some magnets require electricity?
    
    1. Electric currents are magnetic!
    2. A current carrying wire produces a magnetic field
    3. A current carrying coil mimics a bar magnet
    4. An electromagnet typically uses an electric current
        
        - To produce a magnetic field
        - To magnetize a ferromagnet
          
        

Mag fields are produced by

7. Mag poles and subatomic particles
8. Moving electric charges 
Electric fields are produced by

11. Electric charges and subatomic particles
    
**You are working with a magnet, and it breaks in half, you then end up**  
**A) 2 magnets, each with a south and a north pole.**
      

**2 permanent magnets**  
**A) can attract or repel**
   

In a few solids, the cancellation of these dipoles is incomplete  
These materials are called ferromagnetic
   

Soft:  
Hard:  
The opposite
   

The earth produces a magnetic field that
