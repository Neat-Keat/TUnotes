4 questions

1. Why isnt power transmitted via large currents?
    
    1. Too much power would be wasted in the wires
      
    
    Current-carrying wires consume and waste power  
    Large currents waste large amounts of power
     3. Why isnt power delivered via high voltage?
    
    1. High voltage power is dangerous
      
    
    It produces large voltage gradients
    
    - Spark, fire, shock hazard
    
      
      
      
    
4. What is "alternating current" and why use it?
    
    1. Fluctuating current -> so transformers will work
      
    
    - Voltage of power delivery wires alternate
    - The resulting currents normally alternate too!
      
    
    - 60 cycles per second, so V and C reverse every 1/120 seconds
    
    5. AC complicates electronic device design
    6. AC permits the use of transformers
      
    
5. How does a transformer transfer power?
    
    1. Its changing magnetic fields to induce currents
      
    
    - That produces an alternating magnetic field
    - That produces an electric field
    - That pushes current thru the secondary coil
    
    Power moves from primary coil to secondary coil
    
      
    
    - Magnetic poles and subatomic particles
    - Moving electric charges
    - And changing electric fields
    
    - Electric charges and subatomic particles
    - Moving magnetic poles

    10. Moving poles or changing magnetic fields
        
        - Produce electric fields which propel currents thru conductors
        - Produce magnetic fields
    11. Changing magnetic effects induce currents
    12. Induced currents produce magnetic fields 
Transformers  
AC in 1 circuit can induce an AC in a second circuit

- Uses induction to transfer power between its circuits but doesn’t transfer any charges between its circuits
 
Current and Voltage

11. A transformer must obey energy conservations
12. Power arriving in its primary circuit must equal power leaving in its secondary circuit
13. Since power = Voltage * current
    
    - A transformer can exchange voltage for current or current for voltage! 
- Has relatively few turns in its secondary coil
- So charge is pushed a shorter distance
- And experience a smaller voltage rise

A larger current at smaller voltage flows in the secondary circuit
 
- Has relatively many turns in its secondary coil
- Charge is pushed a longer distance
- Experiences a larger voltage rise

A smaller current at larger voltage flows in the secondary circuit
    
Current may flow thru unintended paths
